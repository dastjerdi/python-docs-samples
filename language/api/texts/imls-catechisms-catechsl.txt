A. Yes; “He is about my path and about my bed, and spieth out all my ways.”
Q. You have been taught that, in your baptism, you got your Christian name, got the remission of your sins, and the gift of the Holy Ghost. Now this means that, at baptism, “You were made a member of Christ, a child of God, and an inheritor of the kingdom of heaven.” What were you made at baptism?
A. “I was made a member of Christ, a child of God, and an inheritor of the kingdom of heaven.”
Q. Yes, you were baptised into Christ, as have been taught, and so became “ a member of Christ.” How did you become a member of Christ?
A. By being baptised into Christ.
Q. I told you that Christ is the Head of the church;—What, then, is Christ's body?
A. The church is Christ's body.
Q. Where are we told that Christ is the Head of the church?
A. In that part of the Bible called the New Testament.

A. I ought to live a holy life, as Christ lived.
Q. What ought you to do?
A. I ought to do good, as Christ always did.
Q. You said that, in your baptism, you were, made, also, ‘a child of God;’—Were you a child of God when you were born?
A. No; I was the child of the wicked one.
Q. What is it, then, to be made “a child of God” in holy baptism?
A. It is to be taken out of the family of the wicked one, and put into the family of God.
Q. Yes, in holy baptism, you were made “a child of God”;—As a child of God, what ought you to do?
A. I ought to love and obey my heavenly Father.
Q. You said, too, that in baptism you were made an “inheritor of the kingdom of heaven;”—Now, I want to show you what this means. If I had come to you this morning, and told you that your master [or that some kind friend] had died, and left you a rich present or gift, which you were to have when you were grown up, if you were good children, you would know what I meant, would you not?
A. Yes; I should.
Q. And you would be anxious to be good children, that you might get the rich gift, would you not?
A. Yes; I should.
Q. Well, then, I have come to tell you that Jesus Christ, your blessed Saviour, when He died upon the cross, left you all a rich gift, in heaven, called “eternal life;” and when you were baptised, you were put in the way, if you are good children, of getting that rich gift in heaven—that eternal life;—And so you are called “inheritors of the kingdom of heaven:”—What, then, is it to be made an “inheritor of the kingdom of heaven” at your baptism?
A. It is to be put into the way of getting “the gift of God, which is eternal life.”
Q. If you are thus made inheritors of the kingdom of heaven, ought you not to strive every day to get to heaven?
A. Yes, I ought.
LESSON VIII.
Q. You said that, at your baptism, you were made a member of Christ;—If you do not do good as Christ did, will you continue to be his member?
A. No; I shall be cast away from Christ.
Q. You said that, at your baptism, you were made a child of God;—If you disobey God, will you still be His child?
A. No: If I disobey God, He will not let me be His child.
Q. You said that, at your baptism, you were made inheritors of the kingdom of heaven; but will you get eternal life in heaven, if you do not strive to go there?
A. No; but I shall be sent down to hell.
Q. How are you to strive or try to go to heaven?
A. I must have nothing to do with the devil and his works;—which I gave up at my baptism.
Q. In what way are you to shun the devil and his works?
A. By keeping within me no bad thoughts; by speaking no bad words and by doing no bad things.
Q. What do you mean by keeping within you no bad thoughts?
A. I mean that I must not hate any body, nor wish to hurt any body, nor wish to do any wrong.
Q. What do you say you mean by keeping within you no bad thoughts or wishes?
A. I mean I must not hate any body, nor wish to hurt any body, nor wish to do any wrong.
Q. What do you mean by speaking no bad words?
A. I mean that I must not tell lies, nor call hard names, nor curse and swear.
Q. Who is the Father of lies?
A. The devil is called, in the Bible, “the Father of lies.”
Q. Why is he called the Father of lies?
A. Because he told the first lie; and because he tempts every body else to tell lies.
Q. What was the first lie that the devil told to tempt mankind?
A. He told Adam and Eve, in the garden of Eden, to eat of the forbidden fruit, and it should not hurt them; when God told them it should hurt them.
Q. When they listened to the devil, and ate, did the fruit hurt them?
A. Yes, it did hurt them; and the devil knew it would, when he said it would not.
Q. Does the devil try to make men think now, as he did our first parents, that sin will not hurt them?
A. Yes; he tempts men to think now that sin will not hurt them.
Q. But does sin hurt them?
A. Yes; sin always hurts those who do it.
Q. So the devil is the Father of lies, because he told the first lie, and because he always tries to make men think that lies, and other bad words will not hurt them?
A. Yes; he is the Father of lies because of this.
Q. Whose children, then, are those who tell lies, use hard names, and curse and swear?
A. They are the children of the devil.
Q. When, in baptism, you become the children of God, what do you promise to renounce or give up?
A. “I promise to renounce the devil,” or to tell no lies, use no hard names, and not to curse and swear.
Q. But if you do this after having been made the children of God, what will you again become?
A. The children of the devil.
Q. What do you mean by doing no bad things, such things as the devil tempts you to do?
A. I mean that I must not hurt any body; must not disobey my parents—[nor disobey my master] nor disobey God.
Q. But can you not disobey your parents [and your master] without their knowing it?
A. Yes; but God knows it; for God always sees me.
LESSON IX.
Q. WHAT else must you do to get to heaven?
A. I must believe all that God has told me about the way to get there.

A. The Old Testament and the New Testament.
Q. In which part has God told you most about getting to heaven?
A. In the New Testament, or the Gospel.
Q. What does the Gospel tell you about getting to heaven?
A. It tells me about my Saviour, who showed me how to get there.
Q. Did your Saviour do nothing more than show you how to get to heaven?
A. Yes; He died to open the way for my going there.
Q. Does not the Gospel tell you, too, a good deal about God the Father, and God the Holy Ghost?
A. Yes; It tells me about God the Father, who made me and all the world;—about God the Son, who redeemed me and all mankind;— about God the Holy Ghost, who sanctifieth me and all the people of God.
Q. How much of the Gospel did you promise at your baptism to believe?
A. I promised to believe all the Gospel.
Q. What are the chief parts of the Gospel called in the promises of your baptism?
A. They are called “the Articles of the Christian Faith.”
Q. Yes; they are called the Articles of the Christian Faith; Where are these Articles of the Christian Faith put together?
A. They are put together in the “Apostle's Creed.”
Q. You say the Articles of the Christian Faith are put together in the Apostle's Creed, or belief; —Can you say this creed or belief? Let me hear you;—all saying it slow; first after me.
A.“I believe in God the Father,” &c.
Q. What do you chiefly learn in these articles of your belief?
A. “First, I learn to believe in God, the Father,” who made me and all the world; Secondly, in God the Son, who redeemed me and all mankind; Thirdly, in God the Holy Ghost, who sanctifieth me and all the people of God.”
Q. In order to get to heaven, you say, you promised to give up, or renounce the devil and all his works; and to believe all the Articles of the Christian Faith; but did you not promise still more?
A. Yes; I promised also to keep God's holy will and commandments, and walk in the same all the days of my life.

[Here let the Catechist teach the commandments as found in the Church Catechism.]

Q. You were baptised when you were infants;— how, then, could you promise to keep these commandments, at your baptism?
A. I promised by my sponsors.
Q. Who are your sponsors?
A. Those persons that answered, in my name, when I was baptised.
[Here the Catechist should explain the nature of the sponsorship.]
Do you think that you are bound to believe and do what your sponsors promised for you?
A. Yes; I do think so.
Q. You promised, you say, to keep the commandments;—How must you feel towards God and man, in order rightly to keep them?
A. I must “love God with all my heart; and my neighbor as myself.”
Q. How must you show that you love God with all your heart?
A. I must show it, in delighting above all things to worship and obey God.

A. I am to show it by always doing my duty to my neighbor, as God has commanded me.
Q. Who is your neighbor?
A. Every body who lives with me, and around me, and has the control over me.
Q. Can you name some persons?
A. My playfellows, [my master and mistress] and my parents.
Q. How are you to show your love to your playfellows?
A. I am never to curse them, nor hurt them, but to try always to do them good.
Q. How are you to show your love to [your master and mistress] and your parents?
A. I am never to lie to them, to steal from them, nor speak bad words about them; but always to do as they bid me.
Q. But can you keep the commandments without some one to help you?
A. No; I cannot do it of myself alone.
Q. How do you know this?
A. God says, in the Bible, that “we are not sufficient of ourselves, to think any thing as of ourselves.”
Q. By what means, then, are we to keep God's commandments?
A. By God's help.
Q. How are you to get God's help?
A. By praying for it.
Q. Who has told you so?
A. My blessed Saviour.
Q. What does He say?
A. He says, “ask, and it shall be given you.”
Q. Must you not feel that you want what you ask for?
Yes; I must feel that I want the things I ask for.
Q. Suppose, right after dinner, you should go to your mother and ask for bread, when she knew you did not want it, would she give it to you?
A. No; because I asked for what I did not want.
Q. If you kneel down, then, and pray to God to help you to do good, when you don't wish to do good, will He give you His help?
A. No; because He sees into my heart, and knows that I don't wish Him to help me.
Q. What, then, is it to pray to God?
A. It is to ask God for what I wish to have.
LESSON XI.
Q. Has our blessed Saviour given us the words of a prayer?
A. Yes; He has given us the words of a prayer.
Q. What is the prayer called?
A. It is called The Lord's Prayer.
Q. Why is it called The Lord's Prayer?
A. Because our Lord gave it to us, and commanded us to use it.
Q. Say the Lord's Prayer, will you, altogether, as the people say it at church?
A. “Our Father,” &c.
Q. To whom do you pray, in this prayer?
A. To “Our Father,” in heaven.
Q. Why do you call God your Father?
A. Chiefly, because I was made his child at my baptism.
Q. What were you made at your baptism?
A. “A child of God.”
Q. Yes; you were made God's child at your baptism, and therefore God became, in the best sense, your Father. But is God really a good Father to you?
A. Yes; He is a better Father to me than my earthly father is.
Q. How is God a better Father to you, than your earthly father is?
A. God can do every thing for me which He chooses, but my earthly father cannot do every thing for me which he chooses.
Q. What cannot your earthly father do for you, which God can do for you?

Q. Can your earthly father keep you alive when you are dying?
A. No; he cannot, but God, my heavenly Father, can.

A. No; my earthly father cannot save my soul, but my heavenly Father can save my soul?
Q. But will your heavenly Father save your soul?
A. Yes; if I obey Him, He will save my soul, for Christ's sake.
Q. Ought you not to love your earthly parents very much, for being kind to you?
A. Yes; but I ought to love my heavenly Father a great deal more; for He is a great deal better and more kind to me.
LESSON XII.
Q. You say, God can do for you every thing He chooses; but that your earthly parents cannot;— Where do you say, when repeating the Lord's Prayer, that God is?
A. I say, He is “in heaven.”
Q. What are the words?
A. “Our Father, who art in heaven.”
Q. But, if God is in heaven, can He do you good here on earth?
A. Yes; He can do me good here on earth, because He looks down upon me, and sees me all the while.
Q. But although God sees you all the while, how can He know what you want?
A. God knows what I want; because He knows all things.
Q. God may know what you want; but, if He is up in heaven, can He give you what you want?
