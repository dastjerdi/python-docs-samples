COVENANT.
Forasmuch as Almighty God by his grace, has been pleased to call us, as we hope out of darkness into His marvelous light, and all of us have been regularly baptized on a profession of our faith in Christ Jesus, and have given up ourselves to the Lord, and to one another in a gospel church relation, to be governed and guided by proper discipline, according to God's word; we do, therefore, in the name of our Lord Jesus, and by His assistance, covenant and agree to keep the discipline of the church, of which we are members, in the most brotherly affection toward one another and endeavor punctually to observe the following rules: 1st, In brotherly love to pray for each other, to watch over one another, and if need be in the most tender and affectionate manner to reprove one another; that is if we discover anything amiss in a brother, to go and tell, him of his faults according to the direction given in the 18th chapter of the Gospel by Matthew, and not be whispering and backbiting. 2nd. We also agree, with God's assistance, to pray in our families, attend our church meetings, and not to absent ourselves from the communion of the Lord's supper without a lawful excuse. To be ready to contribute to the defraying of the church expenses, and support of the Missionary, and not irregularly depart from the fellowship of the church, nor remove to distant churches without a regular dismission.
These things we do covenant and agree to observe and keep sacred, in the name of and by the assistance of the Holy Trinity.
AMEN.

REPORTS.
REPORT OF COMMITTEE ON STATE OF THE COUNTRY.
The mystery of iniquity doth already work.
The horizon of the Nation's sky is bedecked with thunder heads of Bolshevism which forecast a coming storm of anarchy are seen; flashes of race riots and industrial cala-clysm sweep the skies of our hopes, which are forerunners of dissatisfaction and overthrow of law and order. To all of this is added general restlessness which is a symptom of fagged mentality and a melancholia Psychology. Patience is almost thread bare; recognition of human brotherhood obsolete; justice a misnomer and righteusness not on program; therefore, we, the Kenansville Eastern Baptist Association in session set our disapproval against any form of disorder whether black or white; and we disclaim any relation with those who may be guilty of stirring up ours or any other people to disorder. We ask for fair deal, ppportunity to live and merit the rights of citizens.

REPORT OF COMMITTEE ON TEMPERANCE.
We, your Committee on Temperance beg to submit our report: In these days of quick impulse, when the nerves of men are unchecked by any recognition of the Most High, we feel that no better virtue than that of self-control can be practiced. Temperance means moderation, self-control. It therefore, demands, discretion in appetite, wisdom in speech and conduct as becometh saints. We set ourselves on record as being out of harmony with any form of intemperance whether it be in food, act or drink. Now that the world is being swept by a wave of prohibition we give our approval to all and any movement that tends to bring about moderation and a normal career. We set our disapproval against any drunkard in the district.
