THE MODERATOR'S ADDRESS, A. H. DUDLEY.
To the New Bern Eastern Missionary Baptist Association of North Carolina, Ladies and Gentlemen, Greeting:
As companions and sojourners through the mazy labyrinth of human life, we are permitted to assemble again in our fifty-third Annual Session, to review as our custom the past year's work and to plan for and renew our efforts of efficient service for another year.
We realize the fact that we are enjoying great blessings to be spared with a reasonable portion of health and strength sufficient to perform whatever duties may devolve upon us. When we think of the unrest of our people, the much commotion throughout our land, and the world-wide bloody wars with its horrors and destructions and too, the many accidents, disasters and dread diseases are hurling into eternity inconceivable numbers of human souls daily, how we should praise our Heavenly Father out of the fullness of our hearts who spares us for a good purpose.
We should gladly spend our lives with much time and strength in His service.
BRETHREN AND SISTERS.
One year or more behind us with its joys and sorrows, its smiles and tears, its rain drops and sunbeams, have gone from us forever. It is also one more year's work for the great cause to which we are espoused. And certainly for the Master, and for the uplift of falling humanity, and our Association are scriptural and tends to help us to grow in love and knowledge of Him whose kingdom is founded on the universal brotherhood of man, and whom we have come to worship.
BROTHERS AND SISTERS.
If your minds have become fully actuated by the excellent system of moral and religious principles, and the many beautiful virtues of our Association, and you have been actively engaged in teaching the meaning of these Divine principles and truly sublime virtues by ways of lectures and exemplification of the object, thereby bringing your Association up to the standard of the right If this is true you have done much toward bringing about activity on the part of indifferent, uninformed, and neglected ones of our Association.
But if you have not done this, then you have played the part of a hypocrite. We admit the roads over which we have passed during these twelve months have been so troublous, the difficulties so pronounced. We meet to-day in our fifty-third annual session. We should congratulate ourselves on belonging to an organization that has for its object such a noble cause. We admit the progress has been slow and very little has been accomplished. In all great events and revolution there are great agencies sometimes unobserved, when we compare the Churches, homes and people to-day with that of fifty-two years ago, and note the improvement along all lines, such as a more intelligent idea of worship, of Christian work of giving, of pure homes, and ask what has wrought this wonderful change.
The answer comes the Churches and the Sunday Schools have been one of the principal agencies, the value of this work cannot be estimated in dollars and cents. Our modern Churches as it is sometimes called, is not a new idea, it is old as Cain and Abel. When our Saviour was upon earth, the people gathered in Churches on the Sabbath day to hear the Scriptures read and explained.
Perhaps the only improvement that has been made is the classification, the Church and Sunday Schools are not for any particular class or age. An ideal Church or Sunday School is one in which all people are gathered, men, women and children and taught the word of God. All Baptist must be firm believers in the Churches and Sunday Schools. A Baptist Church is based on no creed or tradition. It is not governed by laws or regulations made by man. The New Testament is its constitution and rules of order.
A Baptist Church is a pure democracy. All of its members have an equal voice in its government. As the prosperity of a Republic depends upon the intelligence of citizens, so the prosperity of a Baptist Church depends upon its members. Hence the importance of having the members trained in a Bible knowledge, and this work can not be done as well as in the Churches and Sunday Schools. Church and Sunday School workers are forces of light.
Go into any church or a community where there is a well organized Sunday School, and you will find a working Church and well kept homes. The preacher and the teacher needs the sympathy and co-operation of the people, they are engaged in an unselfish work, they receive very small compensation for their services. Yet they go through the rain and snow, hot or cold, and sometimes hardly nowhere to lay their heads. But keeping in line with the Scriptures of our blessed Saviour, “The Foxes have holes and the birds of the air have nests, but the Son of man hath not where to lay his head.” But there is a reward greater than dollars and cents that comes to every faithful preacher and teacher, the reward of self improvement, and a consciousness of helping others.
This Association is an indispensible organization. We are living in an age of organizations. Every thing is organized. In this Association our forces are brought together, a better understanding is secured, and more effective work is done. We get encouragement and inspiration from each other and thus become mutually helpful.
What has been accomplished the year just closing? The reports to which you shall listen to will show progress along all lines of the work the Association has undertaken. We regret very much that on account of the great wide world war, and the high cost of living, and on account of the severe winter, the dreaded diseases and the limited funds for this object, more of our young women and men can not be helped We admit that the attendance of the school was poor. Yes, there are hundreds of young women and men who are standing out in the old field of ignorance with uplifted hands crying help, help. That means that they want an education. Can we listen to the cry of those ignorant young women and men and fold our arms and say they need no help. No, God forbid, Let us invest thousands of dollars for this object. A thousand dollars devoted to the education of our young women and men would be the best that the Association could make. Some things that should claim our immediate attention:
(1) How to strengthen our school forces and made more efficient. Our public schools are being improved, the terms are being lengthened and the schools managed by more competant teachers. And in order that our schools may rush on to a greater success let us lengthen the terms by putting our hands down into our pockets and pay more money.
We regret very much on account of the limited funds and the hard winter that we could not have but two month's term this year. The term was not so good as last years on account of the cold winter and the small attendance. We admit that there is a class of people who care very little for education. The problem with us is how best to reach this class who attends no school. We must become missionaries, going out into the highways and hedges and compelling them to come in.
Brothers and Sisters, let us organize ourselves together and work for the Master's Kingdom, and for the uplift of falling humanity. Organization is necessary, Our County is organized. Not only should every County be organized, but every Township, and thus bring the work in touch with every home. But these organizations should not undertake to support missionaries and do independent work. They should do institute work, and plan to reach the unreached.
Allow me to give you a little scope of the work. In early history of this Association, fifty-three years ago, the principle of its work was the organization of new Churches and Sunday Schools in destitute sections, and strengthening those in existence by introducing the right kind of work.
Since that time this Association has been progressing. It bought four acres of land near James City, and has built a good house and do not owe one cent on it but what can be paid at any time. Now the work of this Association include definite Home Missions, Foreign Missions and education, and our young people are taught to contribute to all these objects. In relation to other bodies, this Association is an independent organization composed of Baptist Sunday School Conventions, Unions and Annual Life Members. It has a definite work field of operation. This is true, it is in hearty accord with every other religious body of the same faith, and extends a hand of fraternal greeting to every religious organization that has for its object the saving of the rising generation and uplift of humanity.
To us the Divine command was given to publish a free salvation and to teach unto every nation what his will is toward us. We can carry out this command in a better way than to begin with the child whose tender heart has not been hardened by sin and disobedience. Here we may plant the seed of love and spiritual grace before this evil day comes, and before the years draw nigh when they say I have no pleasure in them. What a responsibility falls upon a Christian, to daily write our ideals of right or wrong. of love or hate upon an immortal soul. Although we utter not a word, the impression is there. Shall we scatter sunshine along life's dreary way, to cheer and bless and brighten every passing day? What does our institute mean: (1) A deeper and broader study of God's word. When we consider the kind of preachers and teachers we are compelled to employ, and the general lack of preparation which they have for their work, we can easily see that a large percentage of our so called preaching and teaching is a fruitless waste. But we can not afford this Current literature is filled with rightful teaching as to morals and the Christian life, and these teachings are readily and almost unconsciously absorbed by our young people. The old simple faith is being steadily but surely undermined, and many of our young people who ought to grow up into a strong Christian worker, are either drifting away from the Churches, or are becoming positively hostile to their doctrines. A mere pretence of Bible teaching will not avail, though our work must be insisted upon.
Where the pastors are now indifferent, they should be aroused and brought to see the supreme necessity of taking hold of the work of instructing the people, so they may do more for the uplift of falling humanity, and the spread of the gospel among men.
(2) The Churches and Sunday Schools means a more Scriptural evangelism. All critical observers are impressed with two things in our church life to-day. The one is that the old time revival meeting is fast losing its effectiveness, and the other is that the churches must more and more depend upon the Sunday Schools for their increase of members. As to the former, several reasons may be assigned; but it is sufficient to point to the fact that when a church now conducts a revival meeting sinners are conspicuous for their absence. Personal work is the modern method, and who is in such a favorable position for this work as the Churches and Sunday Schools? But the preachers we employ must be Scriptural. There should be laid in the child's mind a foundation of gospel facts. The Biblical way to Christ should be shown and then the appeal made to reason.
(2) The opportunities offered: (1) For saving the next generation of men and women through the children of today. We have this opportunity NOW; we CANNOT have it always. Let us use it to the fullest advantage. (2) For helping the present generation of men and women. Only a few of our grown people know anything about the Bible. It is practically a sealed book to the masses of our people, and yet Christian life is dependent upon Christian knowledge. It is true to-day as it was in the days of Hosea, that God's people are destroyed for lack of knowledge.
(3) Our responsibilities: No obligation is unimportant, while some are supremely important. Such is the responsibility of a preacher or a teacher. It is no trifling thing to have the care of an immortal soul committed to you. The imprint you place on the child's mind will last, and you have only a few brief years in which to do your work. We should all be perfectly upright in our Christian life; earnest in our Bible study, and serious in our preaching and teaching.
(4) Preparation is required: The Preachers who fail to provide for preaching, or refuse or neglect to attend some school ought not to be allowed to preach. Let us notice Paul's message to Timothy 2:15. Study to show thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth. Listen to me. The work is too serious to permit trifling on the part of anybody. The office of a preacher or teacher is no honorary place where they may display their charmes or talents, but a place of downright hard work, both during the services of the Church and sessions of the Schools, and all the time that follows. The preacher must study the Bible so as to know what to preach, and should read regularly some good paper and books.
(5) There should be union among us and the reasons for union: A number of excellent reasons may be given why all the Baptists of the New Bern Eastern Missionary Baptist Association of North Carolina should stand together.
1st. That the Atlantic and North Carolina Industrial Institute of James City, N. C., belonging to this Association needs to be built up. It is a serious reflection on us that we have no adequate provision for the education of our ministers.
2nd. We have allowed this work to drag along until all interest in it seems to be lost. We should provide financial aid to worthy young men who are called to preach, so they may be properly educated for their work. We can not in this day tolerate an incompetent ministry, and many who desire full preparation needs help.
3rd. And we should also aid worthy young Christian women to be educated. Our race has much talent that is not used. The Master has need for this talent. Let us lay hold of it, improve it and consecrate it to the Master's use.
In order to do this I recommend that the Atlantic and North Carolina Industrial Institute of James City, N. C., shall run at least three months with the privilege of five months each year. I also recommend that the fifty-two cents per member shall be paid annually, and also be made constitutional. I further recommend that each Church belonging to this Association shall send one or more students to the Institute at James City, and shall pay half of their expenses for the first year.
I further recommend that each Minister, Licentiate or Ordained belonging to this Association, shall attend the Institute at least one month during session. And we are asking the Churches to stand by us in this, and should they fail to observe this, that the said Churches of which they are pas

duty of all of the officers of the Association shall be prescribed by the Association in its Constitution.
Art. 6. It shall be the duty of the Moderator to enforce an observance of the Constitution, preserve order, appoint committees, decide all questions of order, give his opinion on any question under discussion after others have spoken, and give the casting vote in case of a tie.

They shall have power to take up all grievances of the Churches and Pastors composing this Association, and call them to trial, and give them a fair and Scriptural trial, and if they fail to hear the advice of the Executive Committee, then they shall pass their judgment upon them, or they may withdraw the right hand of fellowship from them, and refer their charge to, the Association.
