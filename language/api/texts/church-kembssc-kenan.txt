PRESIDENT'S ADDRESS.
Faison, N. C., July 18th, 1919.Mr. Vice-President, Officers and Members of this Great Body of Sunday School Workers for Christ and Humanity:
Once more the wheel of Revolution has brought us together in a S. S. Convention, to give an account to Him who rules the universe, and submit to each other our work done in the Master's Vineyard. Since we met last in the historic town of Kenansville there have been many changes in this World's history. In 1918 the cannon was roaring in Europe, and our young men were being called to the colors to defend our Nation's honor. Yes the war cloud was hanging heavy over our horizon, and our statesmen were almost at their wits end, and the paramount question of the day was, What next? Men were called from their schools and seminaries and colleges, to take up arms to fight one common foe, the devil. I said the devil, and why: He it is that stirs up nations to wrath; he it is that tries to hinder the progress of Christianity; he it is that opposes all good work, and marshals his forces against God, and wicked men and nations are his agencies employed to carry out his nefarious plans. This should not be but God suffers many things to come upon His church to try their faith. But God be thanked that this body of Sunday School workers have stood the test. We haulted in our last session and subscribed to War Savings Stamps to the amount of $10.39 as a token of our patriotic spirit, our prayers ascended to the Throne of Grace for our country and her allies, and for the young men who went from us, that victory might be ours, and on the 11th day of November, 1918, the glad tidings were flashed on cables and telephones, and other devices to convey news, that the armistice was signed by the enemies, and peace was at the door. Thus prayer did what guns and warships and submarines could not do. Thank God for teaching us to pray.
The Condition of the Field.
We too have been like Europe in one sense of the word; we have had our wars within and without; we warred against sin, flesh and the devil. We have exclaimed like the Apostle Paul, O wretched man that we were, who shall deliver us from the body of this death? What death is it we want to be delivered from? The death of misunderstanding. We did not really understand each other, and caused a war in the bounds for seven years longer than the war in Turope. And on the 5th Sunday in March, 1919, we stacked arms and signed our treaty of peace, to never engage in another battle against each other, but to fight the enemy. I think the bounds are in the best condition, that they have been in for many years. I have visited some of the schools in the bounds and find them hard at work, but there is room for improvement. One of the greatest setbacks is the delay of the minutes coming from the press and getting in the hands of the Sunday School workers. We think if the minutes could get out sooner the success would be greater, as the District Superintendents would know their fields and Missionaries would know their counties, and for fear of another set back on the part of the minutes I have prepared the commission for the D. D. Superintendents and County Missionaries, that they may have their authorities to work with.
We are passing through one of the perilous times of the age, which time the Apostles warned the Church and S. S. Workers would come. And in this hour of reconstruction we must have the best prepared men and women to lead the race. In Church, in Sunday School and in State, men and women who are born again, and again. I said born two times; yes born of the Spirit, and of the water, and who live the life they profess to teach in our Sunday Schools, who are God's trustees and have the keys of the kingdom, and know how to use them in unlocking the Kingdom, then walk into God's treasury and bring out things new every Sunday, for them they are teaching. And I believe we have them in these bounds. Let us use them to the Glory of God and His Kingdom.
Recommendation.
1. Whereas, the Baptist Family of North Carolina have awaken to the sense of their duty, and on the 22—24th days of this month, will celebrate their 50th year of achievement, (better known as the Year of Jubilee). We recommend, that this Sunday School Convention will represent in this celebration by delegation and in a Finacial way.
2. That we maintain our allegiance to the Baptist State Sunday School Convention by delegation and finance.
3. That this Convention will elect from its body a competent young minister as its General Missionary to travel throughout its bounds, to lecture and preach, organize B. Y. P. U. in the Sunday Schools, to assist the D. D. Superintendents and S. S. Superintendents, in keeping the work and objects of the Convention fresh in the minds of the people.
Our School at Faison, N. C.
This school has done a great work for the race and the cause of Christ and since we have paid off the notes which were against it, and she is now ready to open school this fall, we recommend, that all applications for teachers be made to the Board of Trustees, and approved by the Association, and Convention; and the Corresponding Secretaries of both bodies be instructed to notify all schools and Churches in the bounds of the number of teachers employed, and the salary of each teacher per school month, that the bounds may be awakened and rightly informed of the action of the Board.
I will not make any further recommendations, as the Committee on President's Address may vetoe the same, thus destroying the foundation of one year of study of our leader, and count this work as nothing. May God's blessings rest on one and all of you. Thanking you for the confidence imposed in me for the past ten years, with this I also tender you my resignation as President and whoever shall be your choice, I will assure you that he will have my hearty support.
I am yours for Christ and humanity,JOSEPH N. McKNIGHT, President.
ANNUAL DUES.
REPORT OF COMMITTEE ON FINANCE.
We, your Committee on Finance beg leave to make our report:
REPORT OF TREASURER.
Mr. President and Convention: The following is my report from July, 1918, to July, 1919:
Respectfully submitted,D. A. WILLIAMS, Treasurer.July 18, 1919.
REPORT OF COMMITTEE ON NEW SCHOOLS.
Mr. President and Co-workers: We, your Committee on New Schools, ask to submit the following report, to-wit:
The Baptist Sunday School at Calypso Duplin County.
Respectfully submitted,W. A. DIXON, K. S. MURPHY, HELEN COSTEN, H. T. HOPKINS, DAISY B. STALLINGS, Committee.
REPORT OF COMMITTEE ON TEMPERANCE.
Mr. President: We, your Committee on Temperance, ask to submit the following report, to-wit:
The word Temperance as we understand it means more than strong drink. It means in talking, eating, acting and in fact, not to indulge in anything unbecoming a Christian gentleman or lady; it means virtue, morals, truthfulness in all of our conduct to God and man, if we will define ourselves to these, we will wipe out the question of strong drink.
Respectfully submitted,G. P. ALDERMAN, K. E. EDWARDS, JERRY GRIMES, E. J. STOKES, C. J. MORRISEY, Committee.
REPORT OF COMMITTEE ON DORMITORY.
Mr. President and Co-workers of this great Baptist Convention: We, your Committee on Dormitory, beg leave to make our report.
Our dormitory needs repairing and painting, so let us all join hearts and hands and make it a school second to none.
Whereas, our uprising generation will need more education than we have to keep pace with the times and we must give our children a better education. We need to prepare our boys to help make laws and all obey them, and to keep pace with the laws of Democracy by steadily advancing to a higher civilization. We your committee recommends that all the churches and people unite as one man and one body and as one race and raise more money for the improvement and comfort of our dormitory, both for girls and the boys and see to it that they have better attenion in school.
Respectfully submitted,JNO. C. HERRING, MRS. EMMA COLE, M. T. BUTLER, J. W. HARGROVE, H. L. MIDDLETON, Committee.
REPORT OF COMMITTEE ON CONDITION OF THE COUNTRY.
Mr. President and members of the K. E. M. B. Convention: We, your Committee on Condition of the Country, beg leave to make the following report:
The Goddess of War has had its wrath abated, its lusts appeased so far as the surface is concerned. Our spears are now ready to be beaten into plow shares and our swords into pruning hooks; nations have signed an agreement to not lift up their heels against each other, neither study war any more. Our heavenly Father has kept us by his hand and we are demobilizing, our boys are coming home; see them coming. Our flag still floats over the land of the free and the home of the brave. Our boys have gone over the top. Victory is ours. We met the enemy and they were ours. The hydra-headed monster Lynching appears here and yonder and it seems as though our federal government has no power to stop him. But there will be a Sir Knight greater than Percival, Launcelot or Sir Galahad who will come to the white house and lynching and mob law will be like Banquo's Ghost, who would not down will at last go down and peace will reign once more. God is right though all men have fallen down. Our Baptist forces are marching on. The year of Jubilee has come.
Yours for success,J. T. DEANS, S. T. SHIVER, D. C. FENNELL, J. Mc. NEWKIRK, Committee.
REPORT OF EDUCATION AGENT.
Mr. President and Co-Workers of this Convention:
I was appointed agent for Education. I have been busy working for my Sunday School and other work until I have not had the chance to collect anything for the Convention until since I have been to this Convention which is the small sum of $1.00.

It has been a war within the Convention for seven years and have been divided; so with our school. The war seems to end in the Convention.

We have raised since our last Convention $71.00. Sent to the Convention $13.25. Let us as members of the Convention stand together and work together.
