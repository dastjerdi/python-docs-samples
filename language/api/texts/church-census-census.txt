SUMMARY OF STATISTICS OF COLORED ORGANIZATIONS.
This summary includes statistics for all colored organizations reported, whether these organizations were connected with denominations consisting entirely of such organizations, or with denominations in which colored organizations represented only a part of the membership. The term “colored organization,” as used in this connection, signifies an organization whose membership is composed wholly of negroes or those of negro descent. Including the National Baptist Convention (a branch of the regular Baptists), 17 bodies are reported which are wholly made up of colored organizations, as against 10 given in the report for 1890. Of those given in the report for 1890 two—the Congregational Methodist Church and the Evangelist Missionary Church—have disappeared, while the following 9 appear for the first time in the report for 1906: Colored Primitive Baptists in America; United American Freewill Baptists; Church of God and Saints of Christ; Churches of the Living God (3 bodies); Voluntary Missionary Society in America; Free Christian Zion Church of Christ; and Reformed Methodist Union Episcopal Church. The denominations composed in part of colored organizations are 26 in number, as against 18 in 1890. For these denominations the general and divisional officers were requested to indicate either the divisions (associations, conferences, etc.) that were made up wholly of colored organizations, or the scattered organizations that were composed wholly of colored members, and this method was supplemented, in the case of several denominations, by special correspondence, through which additional lists of colored organizations were secured. In this way an attempt was made to secure a substantially full report of colored organizations, although it is probable that some distinctively colored churches have been omitted. This effort was restricted, however, to churches comprising colored members only, and no attempt was made to ascertain the number of colored communicants belonging to local white churches.
GENERAL SUMMARY FOR 1906.
The general statistics for all the colored organizations at the close of the year 1906 are given in Tables 11, 12, and 14 (pages 538, 540, and 564). The total number of organizations reported for 1906, as shown by these tables, is 36,770. The total number of communicants or members, as reported by 36,563 organizations, is 3,685,097; of these, as shown by the returns for 34,648 organizations, 37.5 per cent are males and 62.5 per cent females.
According to the statistics, these organizations have 35,160 church edifices; a seating capacity for church edifices of 10,481,738, as reported by 33,091 organizations; church property valued at $56,636,159, against which there appears an indebtedness of $5,005,905; halls, etc., used for worship by 1,261 organizations; and parsonages valued at $3,727,884. The number of Sunday schools, as reported by 33,538 organizations, is 34,681, with 210,148 officers and teachers and 1,740,099 scholars.
Compared with the report for 1890, these figures show increases of 13,308 in the number of colored organizations, 1,011,120 in the number of communicants or members, 11,390 in the number of church edifices, and $30,009,711 in the value of church property.
COMPARISON OF ORGANIZATIONS, COMMUNICANTS OR MEMBERS, AND VALUE OF CHURCH PROPERTY, FOR 1906 AND 1890.
The next table shows for 1890 and 1906, by denominations in detail, the number of colored organizations, the number of communicants or members, 1 and the value of church property.
Of the total number of organizations reported for 1906 as shown by this table, 31,393, with 3,207,307 communicants and church property valued at $44,673,049, belonged to the denominations made up wholly of colored organizations, while 5,377, with 477,790 communicants and church property valued at $11,963,110, were connected with denominations made up only in part of colored organizations.
Including denominations made up either wholly or in part of colored organizations in 1906, 6 Baptist bodies reported 19,891 organizations, with 2,354,789 communicants, and church property valued at $26,562,845; and 10 Methodist bodies reported 15,317 organizations, with 1,182,131 communicants and church property valued at $25,771,262. These 2 denominational families reported 35,208 organizations, or 95.8 per cent of the total number of colored organizations reported; 3,536,920 communicants, or 96 per cent of the total number of colored communicants reported; and church property valued at $52,334,107, or 92.4 per cent of the total value of church property reported by colored organizations.

1 Negroes or persons of Negro descent .
2 The organizations shown for this denomination in 1890 were returned at that census as belonging to the Primitive Baptists.
3 The colored organizations returned for this denomination in 1890 are included in the present report as belonging to the Colored Primitive Baptists in America.
Of the total increase in the number of organizations, 12,235, or 91.9 per cent, were in denominations consisting wholly of colored organizations; of the total increase in the number of communicants, 885,994, or 87.6 per cent; and of the total increase in the value of church property, $24,147,908, or 80.5 percent. Including the denominations made up either wholly or in part of colored organizations, the Baptist bodies show an increase over 1890 of 6,602 organizations, or 49.7 per cent, and the Methodist bodies of 6,199, or 68 per cent, these 2 families reporting an increase of 12,801 organizations, or 96.2 per cent of the total. The increase in the number of communicants reported by the Baptist bodies is 951,230, or 67.8 per cent, which is 94.1 per cent of the total increase. For the Methodist bodies the figures show a slight decrease in the number of communicants, owing to the decrease in the number reported for the African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church, due, as already explained (see page 26), to the fact that the number given in the report for 1890 was too high. The increase in the value of church property shown by the Baptist bodies is $16,283,246, or 158.4 per cent, and by the Methodist bodies, $10,945,710, or 73.8 per cent, these 2 families showing an increase in the value of church property of $27,228,956, or 90.7 per cent of the total increase.
It is to be noted that the figures for the Baptists—Northern Convention, include only those colored organizations and members connected with white associations, while those organizations and members connected with exclusively colored associations have been transferred to the Baptists - National Convention (Colored). As a result, in the comparison with 1890 there appears a decrease in the figures for the Baptists—Northern Convention, though the total for the two conventions is not affected. It should be stated, also, that the decrease shown for the Disciples or Christians in the number of organizations and of communicants is probably due in part to incomplete returns for 1906.
STATISTICS OF DENOMINATIONS.
The following tables furnish detailed statistics for those denominations, for each of which at least 10,000 members of colored organizations were reported in 1906, the remaining 26 denominations being combined under one head as “all other bodies.” Those denominations composed in part only of colored organizations are indicated by the word “part” connected with the title. The selected denominations are given in each table in the order of their rank according to the membership reported for 1906.

1 Negroes or persons of Negro descent.
2 Percentage not shown where base is less than 100.
3 For 1906 includes 4 organizations reported by the Primitive Baptists.
4 Decrease.
5 Includes Disciples of Christ and Churches of Christ.
6 Less than one-tenth of 1 per cent.
The body reporting the greatest number of organizations for 1906 is the Baptists—National Convention (Colored), with 18,534, or 50.4 per cent of the total number of colored organizations in the country, while the African Methodist Episcopal Church is next in order with 6,647, or 18.1 percent of the entire number. The 3 leading colored Methodist bodies taken together, with the addition of the colored organizations belonging to the Methodist Episcopal Church, report an aggregate of 14,982 colored Methodist organizations, or 40.7 per cent of the entire number of colored organizations. These 5 bodies, therefore, contain 33,516 colored organizations, or 91.2 per cent of the entire number reported.
The denomination showing the greatest absolute increase in the number of organizations from 1890 to 1906 is the Baptists - National Convention (Colored), with 6,001, the African Methodist Episcopal Church coming next, with 4,166. In the per cent of increase, however, the African Methodist Episcopal Church leads, with 167.9 per cent, while that of the Baptists—National Convention (Colored)—is 47.9 per cent. The decrease shown in the table in the number of colored organizations connected with the Baptists—Northern Convention—and with the Disciples or Christians is due to the reasons already stated. It will be seen from the table that while the rank of the different denominations in 1906 differs considerably from that in 1890, the relative position of the 5 principal bodies is the same for the two years, except that the Methodist Episcopal Church (part), which was second in 1890 in the number of colored organizations, changed places in 1906 with the African Methodist Episcopal Church, which was third in 1890.

1 Negroes or persons of negro descent.
2 Decrease.
3 For 1906 includes 4 organizations, having 102 members, reported by the Primitive Baptists.
4 Includes Disciples of Christ and Churches of Christ.
5 Less than one-tenth of 1 per cent.
The body reporting the greatest number of communicants or members for 1906 is the Baptists—National Convention (Colored), with 2,261,607, or 61.4 per cent of the entire membership of colored organizations, while the denominations next in order are the African Methodist Episcopal Church, 494,777, or 13.4 per cent of the total; Methodist Episcopal Church (part), 308,551, or 8.4 per cent; African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church, 184,542, or 5 per cent; and the Colored Methodist Episcopal Church, 172,996, or 4.7 per cent. The 3 leading colored Methodist bodies, with the addition of the colored organizations belonging to the Methodist Episcopal Church, report a total of 1,160,866 members, or 31.5 per cent of the entire membership of colored organizations; and with the further addition of the Baptists—National Convention (Colored), a total of 3,422,473 members, or 92.9 per cent of the entire membership of colored organizations.
The denomination showing the greatest absolute increase in the number of communicants from 1890 to 1906 is the Baptists—National Convention (Colored), with 912,618; followed by the Methodist Episcopal Church (part), with 62,302, and the African Methodist Episcopal Church with 42,052. In the per cent of increase, however, the Free Baptists (part) lead with 3,913.3 per cent, the report for this body with respect to communicants in colored organizations in 1890 having apparently been incomplete. Next in order are the Protestant Episcopal Church (part), with 541.5 per cent, and the Roman Catholic Church (part), with 163.4 per cent.
In respect to the average number of members per organization, as shown by the table, the Roman Catholic Church (part), leads with 1,062, this being in keeping with the usual large average shown by this body. It is followed by the Baptists—Northern Convention (part), with 302; and the Baptists—National Convention (Colored), with 122.

1 Negroes or persons of Negro descent.
2 Percentage not shown where base is less than 100.
3 Includes 4 organizations having 102 members—45 males and 57 females—reported by the primitive Baptists.
4 Includes Disciples of Christ and Churches of Christ.
From the foregoing table it appears that 34,648 organizations, or 94.2 per cent of the total number, made report as to the sex of communicants; that the number of communicants thus reported was 3,527,660, or 95.7 per cent of the total, and that of this number, 1,324,123, or 37.5 per cent, were males and 2,203,537, or 62.5 per cent, were females. The denominations showing the largest proportion of males are the Roman Catholic Church (part), 47.5 per cent; the Colored Cumberland Presbyterian Church, 46.5 per cent; and the United American Freewill Baptists (Colored), 43.9 per cent. The denominations showing the smallest proportion of males are the Protestant Episcopal Church (part), 35.2 per cent; the Colored Primitive Baptists in America, 35.7 per cent; and the Baptists—Northern Convention (part), 35.9 per cent.
Comparing the colored bodies with the corresponding white bodies, it appears that in almost every instance the colored bodies show a slightly lower percentage of males. Thus the per cent of males for the Methodist bodies as a whole is 38.5; of the African Methodist bodies, 37.3; of the Methodist Episcopal Church, 37.4; of the colored organizations in that body, 37.8; of the Baptists—Northern Convention, 36.5; of the colored organizations, 35.9; of the Protestant Episcopal Church, 35.5; of the colored organizations, 35.2; of the Roman Catholic Church, 49.3; of the colored organizations, 47.5. In 2 bodies reporting both white and colored organizations, the Congregationalists and Presbyterian Church in the United States of America, the reverse is true, the percentage of males for the Congregationalists being 34.1, for the colored organizations, 38.6; of the Presbyterian Church in the United States of America, 36.5; of the colored organizations, 37.4.
As shown by the next table, places of worship, either church edifices or halls, etc., were reported by all but 2.7 per cent of the total number of colored organizations. Of the 35,160 church edifices reported for 1906, the Baptists—National Convention (Colored) are credited with 17,913, or 50.9 per cent; the African Methodist Episcopal Church, with 18.6 per cent; the Methodist Episcopal Church (part), with 10.4 per cent; the Colored Methodist Episcopal Church, with 6.6 per cent; and the African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church, with 6.1 per cent, the per cent distribution for the various bodies corresponding very closely to that for 1890. As compared with 1890, the table shows an increase in the number of church edifices of 11,390, or 47.9 per cent. The denominations showing the greatest absolute increase are the Baptists - National Convention (Colored), with 5,926, and the African Methodist Episcopal Church, with 2,414. Of the denominations reporting more than 100 church edifices in 1890, the Presbyterian Church in the United States of America shows the highest per cent of increase in the number of church edifices for colored organizations, 91.5 per cent. The total number of halls, etc., reported for 1906 was 1,261 as against 1,358 for 1890. Of these the Baptists—National Convention (Colored), are credited with 40.3 per cent, as compared with 48.8 per cent in 1890, and the African Methodist Episcopal Church, with 21.3 per cent, as compared with 2.3 per cent in 1890.

6 Less than one-tenth of 1 per cent.
The per cent distribution for the several denominations, as shown by the table, does not vary much from that for 1890. The increase in seating capacity from 1890 to 1906, according to the table, was 3,681,703, or 54.1 per cent. The denominations showing the greatest absolute increase are the Baptists—National Convention (Colored), 2,169,331, and the African Methodist Episcopal Church, 671,762. In per cent of increase, however, the Free Baptists (part), lead with 5,381.3 per cent, this large increase being due apparently, as previously stated, to incomplete returns in 1890. Next comes the Protestant Episcopal Church (part), with 259.3 per cent.
The average seating capacity per organization reporting, as shown by the table, is 317, ranging from 445 for the Baptists—Northern Convention (part), to 258 for the Disciples or Christians (part).

3 Includes 4 organizations, having no debt on church property, reported by the Primitive Baptists.
4 Includes Disciples of Christ and Churches of Christ
Of the, 34,660 colored organizations reporting value of church property, 9,003, or 26 per cent, reported debt on church property. In the case of the African Methodist Episcopal Church, 40.9 per cent of the organizations reporting property also report debt; and of the Methodist Episcopal Church (part), 38.3 per cent. In the case of the Baptists—Northern Convention (part), for which, however, only 97 organizations reported the value of church property, practically 4 out of 7 report debt. The denomination showing the lowest percentage is the Colored Primitive Baptists in America, only 6.6 per cent of the organizations which reported value of church property also reporting debt.
The total amount of debt reported, as shown by the table, is $5,005,905, or 8.8 per cent of the value of church property reported. The denominations showing the highest percentage of debt as compared with the value of property are the Baptists—Northern Convention (part), 22.9, and the Roman Catholic Church, 11.1; while the denomination showing the lowest percentage is the Colored Primitive Baptists in America, 2.3 per cent. The average for each organization reporting debt is $556. The denominations showing the highest average per organization are the Roman Catholic Church, $9,456; the Baptists—Northern Convention (part), $6,491; and the Protestant Episcopal Church (part), $4,045. The denominations showing the lowest are the United American Freewill Baptists (Colored), $158, and the Colored Primitive Baptists in America, $205. By comparison with the previous table it will be seen that the 5 bodies named rank the same in respect to average debt as in respect to average value of church property reported.

4 Includes Disciples of Christ and Churches of Christ
The table shows that of the 36,770 colored organizations, 4,779, or 13 per cent, reported parsonages. The denomination showing the highest proportion of parsonages as compared with church organizations is the Roman Catholic Church (part). Of the 36 colored organizations reported by this body, 22, or nearly two-thirds, owned parsonages. Of the total number of colored organizations reported by the Methodist Episcopal Church (part), 1,206, or 32.2 per cent, reported parsonages. For the Protestant Episcopal Church (part), the percentage is 29.3; for the African Methodist Episcopal Church, 26.8; and for the Congregationalists (part), 23.1. The denominations showing the lowest percentages are the United American Freewill Baptists (Colored), and the Disciples or Christians, with 2.4 each. The total value of parsonages reported, as shown by the table, is $3,727,884. Of this amount, the African Methodist Episcopal Church reported $1,255,246, or a little more than one-third, while the next in order are the Methodist Episcopal Church (part); Baptists—National Convention (Colored); African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church; and Colored Methodist Episcopal Church, these 5 bodies together reporting $3,238,439, or 86.9 per cent of the total value of parsonages reported. The average value for each organization reporting is $780. The denominations showing the highest average per organization reporting are the Roman Catholic Church (part), $4,973; the Protestant Episcopal Church (part), $2,844; Baptists—Northern Convention (part), $2,088; and Congregationalists (part), $1,281. The denominations showing the lowest are the United American Freewill Baptists (Colored), $246; the Colored Primitive Baptists in America, $481; and the Disciples or Christians (part), $488.

3 Includes 4 organizations making no returns for Sunday schools, reported by the Primitive Baptists.
4 Includes Disciples of Christ and Churches of Christ
The table shows that of the total colored organizations, 33,538, or 91.2 per cent, reported Sunday schools. The denominations showing the highest percentages of Sunday schools, as compared with the total number of organizations, are the Colored Cumberland Presbyterian Church, with 98 per cent, and the Presbyterian Church in the United States of America, with 97.1 per cent. The denominations showing the lowest percentages, as compared with the total number of organizations, are the Colored Primitive Baptists in America, with 20.7 per cent, and the United American Freewill Baptists (Colored), with 39.8 per cent, the low percentage shown for these 2 bodies probably being due in part to incomplete returns.
The total number of Sunday schools reported is 34,681. Of these, the Baptists—National Convention (Colored) reported 51.6 per cent, a little more than one-half; the African Methodist Episcopal Church, 18.1 per cent; the Methodist Episcopal Church (part), 10.8 per cent; the Colored Methodist Episcopal Church, 6.7 per cent; and the African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church, 6 per cent, these 5 bodies reporting 32,360 Sunday schools, or 93.3 per cent of the total number reported by colored organizations.
The total number of Sunday school officers and teachers reported was 210,148. Of these the Baptists—National Convention (Colored) reported nearly one-half; the African Methodist Episcopal Church, 20 per cent; the Methodist Episcopal Church (part), 12.4 per cent; the African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church, 7.7 per cent; and the Colored Methodist Episcopal Church, 5.9 per cent, these 5 bodies reporting 196,674 Sunday school officers and teachers, or 93.6 per cent of the entire number reported by colored organizations.
The total number of Sunday school scholars reported by colored organizations is 1,740,099. Of these, the Baptists—National Convention (Colored) reported 924,665, or a little more than one-half; the African Methodist Episcopal Church, 16.8 per cent; the Methodist Episcopal Church (part), 11.8 per cent; the African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church, 6.2 per cent; and the Colored Methodist Episcopal Church, 5.3 per cent, these 5 bodies reporting 1,622,313 Sunday school scholars, or 93.2 per cent of the entire number reported by colored organizations.
DISTRIBUTION OF COMMUNICANTS OR MEMBERS BY STATES AND TERRITORIES.
The statistics of colored organizations for 1906, for all denominations, are given by states and territories in Table 12 (page 540). The following table shows this distribution for communicants or members alone for 1890 and 1906, and the relative position of each state at the two periods:

1 Negroes or persons of Negro descent.
2 Idaho, Nevada, North Dakota, and Vermont had no colored organizations in 1906 or 1890.
3 Oklahoma and Indian Territory combined.
From the number of communicants given in this table, it appears that 1 state reports a membership of over 500,000; 4 report a membership of from 300,000 to 400,000; and 7, a membership of from 100,000 to 300,000. These 12 states report a total colored membership in 1906 of 3,202,853, or 86.9 per cent of the entire membership of colored organizations. The same states reported a membership in 1890 of 2,398,865, or 89.7 per cent of the entire membership of colored organizations at that time. The relative position of the different states varied somewhat at the two censuses. Georgia was the leading state at each census, while 5 others of the 12 states—Arkansas, Florida, Kentucky, Texas, and Virginia—held the same relative position in 1906 as in 1890. On the other hand, South Carolina, which was second in 1890, changed places in 1906 with Alabama, which was third in 1890, while North Carolina changed places with Mississippi, and Louisiana with Tennessee.
In addition to the 12 states already named, Delaware, Maryland, West Virginia, and the District of Columbia, in the South Atlantic division, and Oklahoma, in the South Central division, reported a comparatively large colored membership. These 2 geographic divisions, the South Atlantic and South Central (see Table 12), reported in 1906 a total membership for colored organizations of 3,375,546, and in 1890 the same states reported a corresponding membership of 2,495,031, or somewhat more than nine-tenths—91.6 and 93.3 per cent, respectively—of the total colored membership reported for continental United States at each census.
Outside of the South Atlantic and South Central divisions, the states reporting in 1906 the largest membership for colored organizations are, Pennsylvania, 60,161; Missouri, 50,074; Ohio, 33,667; Illinois, 32,058; and New York, 30,482. Ohio held the same relative position in 1906 as in 1890, while Pennsylvania changed places with Missouri, and Illinois with New York. Of all the states and territories, Oklahoma shows the highest percentage of increase in members of colored organizations, namely 3,208.5 per cent. Five states—North Carolina, Michigan, Oregon, Wyoming, and Maine--report a smaller number of members in 1906 than in 1890. The decrease shown for North Carolina is due largely to the decrease in the number of members reported for the African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church, which is especially strong in North Carolina. The states reporting no members of colored organizations either in 1890 or 1906 are Idaho, Nevada, North Dakota, and Vermont.
COLORED MINISTERS.
The number of ordained colored ministers connected with denominations made up wholly of colored organizations, as reported for 1890 and 1906, is given in detail by denominations in Table 8 (page 514). The table following shows for each of these denominations the number of ministers and the number of organizations reported in 1906.

1 Negroes or persons of negro descent.
The table shows that for the denominations made up wholly of colored organizations, the total number of ministers reported for 1906 was 31,624, and the total number of organizations 31,393. Of the total number of ministers, 17,117, or 54.1 per cent, were connected with the Baptists—National Convention (Colored); 6,200, or 19.6 per cent, with the African Methodist Episcopal Church; 3,082, or 9.7 per cent, with the African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church; 2,671, or 8.4 per cent, with the Colored Methodist Episcopal Church; and 1,480, or 4.7 per cent, with the Colored Primitive Baptists in America, these 5 bodies having 30,550 ministers, or 96.6 per cent of the entire number of ordained ministers reported for denominations composed wholly of colored organizations. For 3 of these bodies, namely, United American Freewill Baptists (Colored), the Church of God and Saints of Christ (Colored), and the African Methodist Episcopal Church, the number of ministers is estimated because complete information was not obtainable. The number of colored ministers connected with denominations partly made up of colored organizations is not known. Estimating it on the basis of the number of ministers per organization for each of these denominations as a whole, the number is approximately 3,600. If this number be added to the number connected with denominations composed wholly of colored organizations, an estimated total is obtained of 35,224 ministers of Colored organizations in continental United States, as compared with 36,770 colored organizations belonging to the denominations in question.

NATIONAL BAPTIST CONVENTION (COLORED).
HISTORY.
The early history of colored Baptists in the United States is so interwoven with that of the white Baptists that it can scarcely claim any distinctive record. In the days of slavery these people were always under the supervision of their masters, and for the most part attended services in the same churches. The first distinctively colored Baptist church was one formed at Williamsburg, Va., in 1785, which, however, afterwards disbanded and was reorganized. The first to have an unbroken history is the First African Baptist Church of Savannah, Ga., organized on January 20, 1788, at Brampton's Barn, 3 miles west of Savannah, by Abraham Marshall, white, and Jesse Peter, colored. Its first pastor was a slave named George Leile, who was liberated by Mr. Henry Sharp, of Burke county, Ga., and afterwards became pastor of a colored Baptist, church at Kingston, Jamaica.
This First African Baptist Church grew, and in 1802 and 1803, two more churches were organized, the Second Colored Baptist Church with 200 members, and the Ogeechee Colored Baptist Church with 250 members. These are still in existence and are strong and prosperous churches. In 1805 the Joy Street Baptist Church, the first in New England, was organized in Boston, Mass.; in 1808, the Abyssinian Baptist Church, in New York City; and in 1809, the First African Baptist Church, in Philadelphia. These three were the first colored Baptist churches in the North. Meanwhile colored Baptists had multiplied in the South, but, since they had no ecclesiastical organization, any attempt to present a consecutive history is extremely difficult.
The First Baptist Church of Washington, D.C., organized in 1802, included in its membership many colored people. In 1833, when the congregation removed to a new edifice, the colored members were encouraged to continue in the old building. In 1839 they organized as the Nineteenth Street Baptist Church, and the building passed into their hands. This experience in Washington was repeated in many places in the South, where the colored members worshiped with white organizations until it seemed wise them to have their own churches. Thus, even before the civil war, a large number of colored Baptist churches existed, both in the North and the South, and since then the growth had been remarkable.
DOCTRINE AND POLITY.
In doctrine and polity the colored Baptists are in close accord with the Northern and Southern conventions. They represent the more the more strictly Calvinistic type in doctrine, and in polity refer the settlement of any difficulties that may arise to an ecclesiastical council. Their churches unite in associations, generally along state lines, for the discussion of topics relating to church life, the regulation of difficulties, the collection of statistics, and the presentation of annual reports. These meetings are consultative and advisory rather than authoritative. Probably the oldest of these associations is the Wood River Association of Illinois, organized in 1838. The first one organized in the South was in Louisiana in 1865.
In addition to the associations there are conventions, which are held for the consideration of the distinctively missionary side of church life, and not infrequently extend beyond state lines. The first of these was organized in North Carolina in 1866, the second and third in Alabama and Virginia in 1867, the fourth in Arkansas in 1868, and the fifth in Kentucky in 1869.
WORK.
Previous to 1880 there were three general organizations or societies among the colored Baptists for evangelistic and educational work. These were the New England Missionary Convention, the Consolidated American Missionary Convention, and the General Association of Western States and Territories. In 1880 the National Baptist Convention was organized and the Consolidated Convention and the General Association were merged in it. The New England Convention still retained its identify, but now works through the National Convention. The special object of the National Convention, at the time of its organization, was stated to be “to consider the moral, intellectual, and religious growth of the denomination, to deliberate upon the great questions which characterize the Baptist churches, and further, to devise and consider the best methods possible for bringing us more closely together, both as churches, and as a race.”
In the same year the Foreign Mission Convention of the United States was organized, and in 1890 the National Baptist Educational Convention. In 1895 both the Foreign Mission Convention and the Educational Convention were merged in the National Baptist Convention, in accordance with the following minute: “Whereas, it is the sense of the colored Baptists of the United States of America, convened in the city of Atlanta, Ga., September 28, 1895, in the several organizations known as the Baptist Foreign Mission Convention of the United States, hitherto engaged in mission work on the west coast of Africa; the National Baptist Convention, which has been engaged in mission work in the United States of America; and the National Baptist Educational Convention, which has sought to look after the educational interest, that the interests of the Kingdom of God require that the several bodies above named should, and do now, unite in one body. The object of this convention shall be to do now, unite in one body. The object of this convention shall be to do mission work in the United States of America, in Africa, and elsewhere abroad, and to foster the cause of education.”
Membership in the National Baptist Convention is of two classes: (1) Churches, Sunday schools, or other organizations which pay an annual fee of $5 are entitled to membership through delegates; (2) individuals may become members by a payment of $1 annually, or life members by the payment of $10. At the annual meetings of the convention, the general interests of the churches are considered, and members of the following boards are elected: Foreign Missions, Home Missions, Education, Baptist Young People's Union, Publishing, and National Beneficial Association. The last-mentioned board has for its object ministerial relief.
The Lott-Carey Convention for Foreign Missions was organized in 1897, and conducted its work independently until 1906, when it became a district convention of the National Convention. In 1900 the Colored Women's National Baptist Convention, auxiliary to the older society, was organized, having similar boards, and electing its members in the same way.
The home mission work of the colored Baptists is carried on chiefly through the Home Mission Board, with headquarters at Little Rock, Ark. This board cooperates with the Southern Baptist Convention; supported 66 missionaries in 1906, and collected $17,628. Its principal work is in the Southern states, though it is not confined to them. In close relation with the Home Mission Board is the Sunday School Publishing House at Nashville, Tenn., the largest and best equipped of its kind among the colored people, with property valued at $200,000 and a business amounting, in 1906, to $160,152.
The foreign mission work, under the care of the Foreign Mission Board, located at Louisville, Ky., is carried on in Central Africa, South Africa, West Africa, the West Indies, and northern South America. In 1906 there were reported 8 missionaries and 132 native helpers, occupying 72 stations; 33 churches with 8,074 members; 32 schools with 5,781 pupils; and contributions to the amount of $18,727. The property owned is valued at $29,650.
There are 57 schools among the colored Baptists, 31 of which are supported by the American Baptist Home Mission Society of New York, while 26, with 5,200 students, are owned and controlled by the National Baptist Educational Board, with headquarters at Nashville, although they receive assistance from other sources. The 31 schools under the American Baptist Home Mission Society include 12 colleges and 19 secondary schools, with property valued at $1,200,000, for the support of which, during the year 1906, $201,779 was contributed by the society. The schools controlled by the National Board include 9 colleges and 17 schools for secondary education, with property valued at $600,000, for the support of which the colored Baptists gave, during the year, $80,000. Recently the Colored Women's National Baptist Convention has purchased a school in the District of Columbia, the Woman's Baptist Training School.
The denomination supports 14 philanthropic institutions, having approximately 1,000 inmates and property valued at $100,000.
The young people's work is under the general supervision of the National Baptist Young People's Union, with headquarters at Nashville, Tenn., which reports 8,694 societies and 342,050 members. The contributions made to the Union in 1906 were $10,100, and it has property valued at $6,000. The aim is to have a local union in each church to cooperate with the National Union, develop the spirit of personal Christian activity, and stimulate denominational pride.
The colored Baptists have a number of religious and denominational papers. The National Baptist Union at Nashville is the accredited organ of the denomination, but the Christian Banner of Philadelphia has the largest circulation, and the American Baptist of Louisville is the oldest among the colored Baptist journals. All are doing good service in the development of denominational and church life.
STATISTICS.
The general statistics of the National Baptist Convention at the close of the year 1906, as derived from the returns of the individual church organizations, are given by states and ecclesiastical divisions in the tables which follow. As shown by these tables, the convention has 18,534 organizations, contained, with the exception of 184 unassociated, in 571 associations, located in 33 states, the territory of New Mexico, and the District of Columbia. Of these organizations, more than one-half are in the South Central division. The state having the largest number is Georgia with 2,504; followed by Mississippi with 2,236; Alabama with 1,977; and Texas with 1,763.
The total number of communicants reported is 2,261,607; of these, as shown by the returns for 18,034 organizations, about 37 per cent are males and 63 per cent females. According to the statistics, the convention has 17,913 church edifices; a seating capacity for church edifices of 5,610,301, as reported by 17,316 organizations; church property valued at $24,437,272, against which there appears an indebtedness of $1,757,190; halls, etc., used for worship by 508 organizations; and 709 parsonages valued at $617,241. The Sunday schools, as reported by 17,478 organizations, number 17,910, with 100,069 officers and teachers and 924,665 scholars.
The number of ministers connected with the convention is 17,117, and there are also a large number of licentiates.
As compared with the report for 1890, these figures show an increase of 6,001 organizations, 912,618 communicants, and $15,398,723 in the value of church property.
It should be noted that, as already explained (see page 27, Part 1), the figures here given for the National Baptist Convention include organizations in colored associations in Northern states, while in the report for 1890 the colored associations then existing in the Northern states were reported in connection with the Northern Baptist Convention. For this reason the figures are not entirely comparable with those for 1890.

COLORED PRIMITIVE BAPTISTS.
COLORED PRIMITIVE BAPTISTS IN AMERICA
HISTORY.
The colored members of the Primitive Baptist churches of the South, during the years of slavery, shared the experience of others of their race. They were allowed to sit in the galleries during church service, but had no voice in the management of the churches, were compelled to baptize at night, and those of their number who were called to preach were simply exhorters, with no authority over their congregations.
With the emancipation a change came, and they were obliged to leave the white churches. In 1865 the White Springs Primitive Baptist Church was organized by Elder Thomas Williamson, at Columbia, Tenn. Several appeals were made to the white Primitive Baptists for his ordination to the work of the gospel ministry, but without success, and he, with two others, after a time of fasting and prayer, believing that the Lord through His spirit had revealed to them the answer to their prayers, knelt and laid their hands on each other's heads, receiving, as they felt, the “power of the Holy Ghost.” They arose and started out to preach, to baptize, and to establish churches; and in 1866 the Big Harpeth Primitive Baptist Association was organized in the state of Tennessee. Soon other churches began to spring up in the Southern states. In Georgia a presbytery of white Primitive Baptist elders ordained Henry Griffin in 1867, and two years later the Antioch Association, the first Colored Primitive Baptist Association in that state, was organized. In 1867, also, the first church was formed in west Florida and the West Florida Association was constituted. The next year the Indian Creek Association in north Alabama was formed by Bartley Harris, who had gathered a church at Huntsville, and in 1869 the Rev. E. E. Gardner and others organized the Southwest Alabama Association. In Texas Elder Moffett began the work of rallying the Colored Primitive Baptist forces in 1869.
For years the churches showed little vitality, divisions occurred in the associations, generally on doctrinal matters, and “no-fellowship bars” were set up. In 1900 a great awakening began; opposition to modern methods was overborne; and since then “Union, Peace, and Progress” has been their motto. The result has been that the Colored Primitive Baptists differ in many respects from the white churches of the same faith and order, and at present the denomination might be called the “Reformed Primitive Baptists of America.” In doctrine they have reverted to the older basis, and in their church organization and activities they are in full accord with modern methods. They demand an educated ministry, believe in Sunday schools, young people's societies, women's auxiliaries, state conventions, ministerial support, etc., and are organizing their forces, and sending out district, state, and national evangelists through all parts of the country.
DOCTRINE.
The doctrinal basis of the Colored Primitive Baptists is not the Black Rock Address of 1832, still widely accepted by the white Primitive Baptists, but the London Confession of Faith, adopted in 1689 by the Particular Baptists of England, and, in a slightly modified form, as the Philadelphia Confession, by the great majority of American Baptists. It is thoroughly Calvinistic, emphasizing the five points of Calvinism—predestination, particular redemption, total depravity, effectual calling or regeneration, and the certain perseverance of the saints.
The church ordinances include baptism, the Lord's Supper, and washing the saints' feet. Baptism is by immersion, and must be administered by a properly ordained person. The rite of foot-washing is observed not “as a Jewish tradition or custom, but as a matter of faith in Christ, and in obedience to the example given by Him;” the sacramental service is not considered complete until this rite is performed.
POLITY.
In polity the Colored Primitive Baptist churches are in full accord with other Baptist bodies. The local church is supreme in its authority over its members, in its selection of officers, and in the general conduct of its affairs. Each church holds, once a month, a church conference, where its business is conducted, and the decisions of this conference are final, there being no appeal to any other authority. Associations of churches are organized for the purpose of mutual improvement and spiritual development, and for greater effectiveness in spreading the gospel. Membership in these associations is not obligatory, but churches which hold such membership are expected, through pastor or delegate to the annual session, to report as to membership and financial receipts and expenditures for church, evangelistic, educational, benevolent, or associational purposes. There is also a state convention which includes the associations, churches, and other organizations within its bounds, and which has general direction of state evangelists.
The church offices recognized as scriptural are those of pastor and deacon. Pastors are elected and called by a majority of the members of the local church, to preach, oversee the spiritual affairs of the church, and administer the ordinances. The deacons assist the pastor in the temporal work of the church, while each church covenants to give its pastor support.
A candidate for the ministry must be called of God, approved by the church for his gifts and personal character, and ordained and set apart to the work of the ministry by a presbytery of regularly ordained ministers, by prayer and laying on of hands. In addition to those engaged in pastoral work, there are evangelists who travel, organize churches, and encourage and strengthen the work at large.
WORK.
The activities of the church are under the general care of a national convention organized recently as an administrative rather than as an ecclesiastical body. It has for its purpose the consolidation of the Colored Primitive Baptist churches, associations, societies, etc., in the several states into one united national body, and the organization of the national work in the following departments: Financial, educational, young people's and Sunday school, benevolence and church aid fund, publication, woman's auxiliary, bureau of information and statistics, and national memorial building fund. The membership consists of delegates elected by the churches, associations, and state conventions; each church and organization being entitled to delegates on payment of a certain amount. Each department is conducted by a board elected by the national convention, and consisting of two members from each state represented in the convention.
The Young People's and Sunday School Congress is the national organization of the Primitive Baptist Young People's Volunteer Band and the Sunday schools of the various churches. The Young People's Volunteer Band was organized at Jacksonville, Fla., in 1900, and reports 259 local bands with a membership of 6,770. The national convention and its auxiliaries are conducting a number of enterprises for the benefit of the denomination at large. Among them are the erection of a $10,000 memorial building at Huntsville, Ala.; the publication of 2 weekly religious journals and a monthly Sunday school paper.
The educational department has under its auspices 3 institutions, an industrial and theological college at Winston-Salem, N. C.; an academy at Thomaston, Ala.; and a seminary at Tallahassee, Florida.
STATISTICS.
The general statistics of the denomination at the close of the year 1906, as derived from the returns of the individual church organizations, are given by states and associations in the tables which follow. As shown by these tables, the denomination has 797 organizations, in 48 associations, distributed in 14 states. There are 187 organizations in Alabama, 150 in Georgia, 128 in Florida, and 96 in Tennessee.
The total number of communicants reported is 35,076; of these, as shown by the returns for 325 organizations, about 36 per cent are males and 64 per cent females. According to the statistics, the denomination has 501 church edifices; a seating capacity for church edifices of 94,223, as reported by 318 organizations; church property valued at $296,539, against which there appears an indebtedness of $6,968; halls, etc., used for worship by 44 organizations; and 21 parsonages valued at $10,095. There are 166 Sunday schools reported, with 911 officers and teachers and 6,224 scholars.
The number of ministers is reported as 1,480, and there are a number of licentiates.
These churches appear to have been included with the white Primitive Baptist churches in the census of 1890.

UNITED AMERICAN FREEWILL BAPTISTS (COLORED).
HISTORY.
For some years after the civil war the lines between the white and colored Freewill Baptist churches in the Southern states seem not to have been drawn very sharply. As, however, the latter increased in number and in activity, there arose among them a desire for a separate organization. Their ministers and evangelists, together with others, had gathered a number of churches in North Carolina, Georgia, Alabama, and Florida, and had met with such success that in 1901 they were organized as a separate denomination. While ecclesiastically distinct, these colored Baptists are in close relation with the white Freewill Baptist churches of the Southern states, and trace their origin to the early Arminian Baptist churches of the Carolinas and Virginia and the Free Baptist movement in New England.
DOCTRINE AND POLITY.
In doctrine the colored Freewill Baptists are in substantial agreement with the white churches of the same faith. In polity the local churches are not as completely autonomous as is the case in the other Freewill Baptist bodies. The denomination has a system of quarterly, annual, and general conferences, with a graded authority. Thus, while the local church is independent so far as concerns its choice of officers, its government, and the transaction of its business, any doctrinal question which it can not decide is taken to the district quarterly conference or to the annual conference. The district conference has no jurisdiction over the individual members of the local church, but can labor with the church as a body and exclude it from fellowship. In the same way the annual conference, sometimes called an “association,” has authority in matters of doctrine over the district or quarterly conference; and the general conference has similar jurisdiction over the annual conference. The general conference has also supervision over the denominational activities of the church, including missions, education, and Sabbath school work, and general movements, as those for temperance, moral reform, and Sabbath observance.
WORK.
The missionary work, whether home or foreign, is as yet unorganized, but pastors are actively engaged in meeting the needs of unoccupied sections, and the Woman's Home Mission and Education Society is doing a great deal of good in this line. The church has two large schools-one, Kinston College, in North Carolina, the other at Dawson, Ga.-and preparations are being made to establish still another. There is also a printing establishment at Kinston, N. C., which issues a weekly paper.
STATISTICS.
The general statistics of the denomination at the close of the year 1906, as derived from the returns of the individual church organizations, are given by states and by conferences in the tables which follow. As shown by these tables, the denomination has 251 organizations in 8 conferences, located in 5 states, the majority, 133, being in North Carolina, and 93 in Georgia.
The total number of communicants reported is 14,489; of these, as shown by the returns for 135 organizations, about 44 per cent are males and 56 per cent females. According to the statistics, the denomination has 152 church edifices; a seating capacity for church edifices of 39,825, as reported by 137 organizations; church property valued at $79,278, against which an indebtedness of $3,485 is reported; halls, etc., used for worship by 8 organizations; and 6 parsonages valued at $1,475. There are 100 Sunday schools reported, with 382 officers and teachers and 3,307 scholars.
The number of ministers connected with the denomination is estimated at 136.
This body is not mentioned in the report for 1890; it was not then in existence as a separate denomination.

CHURCH OF GOD AND SAINTS OF CHRIST (COLORED).
HISTORY.
In the latter part of 1896 William S. Crowdy, a colored man employed on the Santa Fe railroad as a cook, claimed to have a vision from God, calling him to lead his people to the true religion, and giving him prophetic endowment. He immediately gave up his employment, went into Kansas, commenced preaching, and soon after organized the Church of God and Saints of Christ, at Lawrence. At first only a few persons joined him, but the numbers increased rapidly, and the headquarters were removed to Philadelphia. He was appointed bishop of the new body, and two white men who were associated with him were subsequently raised to the same office.
DOCTRINE.
Believing that the Negro race is descended from the ten lost tribes of Israel, the prophet taught that the Ten Commandments and a literal adherence to the teachings of the Bible, including both the Old and the New Testament, are man's positive guides to salvation. In order, however, that the faithful may make no mistake as to the commandments which they are to follow, a pamphlet has been published by the church under the direction of the prophet, called the “Seven Keys,” which includes Bible references giving the authority for the various customs and orders of the church. Among these customs are the observance of the Jewish calendar and feast days, especially the Jewish Sabbath, and the use of the corresponding Hebrew names.
Admission to the church follows repentance for sin, baptism by immersion, confession of faith in Christ, the reception of unleavened bread and water at the sacrament of the Lord's Supper, the washing of the feet by an elder, and the pledge of the holy kiss. The last mentioned is also a general form of greeting, but, having been criticised severely, it is frequently omitted.
POLITY.
The organization of the church centers in an executive board or council, called a “presbytery,” consisting of 12 ordained elders and evangelists, whose duty it is to look after the general business of the church. The prophet, who is presiding officer both of the executive board and of the church, is not elected, but holds his position by virtue of a divine call. He is believed by his followers to be in direct communication with the Deity, to utter prophecies by the will of God, and to perform miracles. On his death the prophetic office lapses until a new vision appears.
There are also district assemblies, composed of the different orders of the ministry, and including delegates from each local church or tabernacle. The ministerial order includes ministers not in full ordination, elders fully ordained, evangelists (elders engaged in general missionary work), and bishops, the last mentioned not exceeding 4 in number. The ministers hold office during good behavior. The temporal affairs of the church are cared for by deacons under general supervision of the assemblies.
WORK.
For the support of the ministry, including the prophet, tithes are collected, as well as freewill offerings, and the district assemblies are required to establish storehouses for the tithes. From these storehouses groceries and other necessaries of life are sold to the members, the net receipts being used to supplement the tithes contributed for the support of the ministers in the work.
The church is a strong advocate of temperance, refusing even to use wine in the sacrament of the Lord's Supper. It allows marriage only within the circle of the faithful, except by special permit, and exercises a rigid censorship over all printed matter, permitting only that to be used which receives the approval of the publishing house, and referring the decision of all disputed points to the Bible.
One of the main auxiliaries of the church is an organization known as the “Daughters of Jerusalem” and “Sisters of Mercy.” It is the duty of this organization to look out for straying members, and attend to the comfort or welfare of the members of sister churches of the organization who may chance to be visiting the place in which the tabernacle is located.
STATISTICS.
The general statistics of the denomination at the close of the year 1906, as derived from the returns of the individual church organizations, are given by states in the tables which follow. As shown by these tables, the denomination has 48 organizations, located in 14 states and the District of Columbia. Of these organizations, one-half are in the North Atlantic division, and all but 4 of the remainder in the South Atlantic division.
The total number of communicants reported is 1,823; of these, about 30 per cent are males and 70 per cent females. According to the statistics, the denomination has 1 church edifice with a seating capacity of 400, and church property valued at $6,000, with no indebtedness, while 47 organizations are reported as worshiping in halls. There is 1 Sunday school reported, with 6 officers and teachers and 150 scholars.
The number of ministers connected with this denomination is estimated at 75.

CHURCHES OF THE LIVING GOD (COLORED).
GENERAL STATEMENT.
In 1899 the Rev. William Christian organized a church at Wrightsville, Ark., with about 120 members. Holding in general to the articles of faith of the Baptist churches, but adopting the Methodist polity, this church became popular, and others were formed on the same basis. The new denomination was called the “Church of the Living God,” and grew rapidly, but suffered from dissensions, which resulted in the organization of 3 distinct bodies, as follows:
SUMMARY OF STATISTICS.
A summary of the general statistics for these bodies at the close of the year 1906, as derived from the returns of the individual church organizations of each denomination, is presented in the tables which follow. These bodies, taken together, have 68 organizations. The total number of communicants, as reported by 67 organizations, is 4,276; of these, about, 39 per cent are males and 61 per cent females.
According to the statistics, there are in all 45 church edifices; a seating capacity for church edifices of 10,635; church property valued at $58,575, against which there appears an indebtedness of $3,410; halls, etc., used for worship by 23 organizations; and 2 parsonages valued at $1,500.

CHURCH OF THE LIVING GOD (CHRISTIAN WORKERS FOR FRIENDSHIP).
HISTORY.
The original Church of the Living God, called “Christian Workers for Friendship,” continues under the leadership of William Christian. Its distinctive characteristics are believers' baptism by immersion, the washing of the saints' feet, and the use of water and unleavened bread in the Lord's Supper. The local organizations are known as “temples” rather than as “churches,” and are subject to the authority of a general assembly. The presiding officer is styled the “chief” or “bishop,” and the ministry includes evangelists, pastors, and local preachers.
A considerable number of ministers are engaged in general missionary work for the extension of the church; Sunday schools occupy a prominent place in the church life; and there is a gospel extension club engaged in works of mercy, particularly along the lines followed by fraternal societies, rendering assistance in the care of the sick and the burying of the dead.
STATISTICS.
The general statistics of the denomination at the close of the year 1906, as derived from the returns of the individual church organizations, are given by states in the tables which follow. As shown by these tables, the denomination has 44 organizations, located in 12 states, 36 of the number being in the South Central division.
The total number of communicants reported is 2,676; of these, about 37 per cent are males and 63 per cent females. According to the statistics, the denomination has 27 church edifices with a seating capacity of 5,985; church property valued at $23,175, against which there appears an indebtedness of $1,710; and halls, etc., used for worship by 17 organizations.

CHURCH OF THE LIVING GOD (APOSTOLIC CHURCH).
HISTORY.
The Apostolic Church, also called the “Christian Friendship Workers,” withdrew from the Church of the Living God (Christian Workers for Fellowship), partly because of opposition to the head of that body, and partly because of a different conception of church government. In this body the presiding officer is styled “president” instead of “chief,” or “bishop.”
In doctrine and polity, with this particular exception, it is in close accord with the parent body.

FREE CHRISTIAN ZION CHURCH OF CHRIST (COLORED).
HISTORY.
The Free Christian Zion Church of Christ was organized on July 10, 1905, at Redemption, Ark., by a small company of colored ministers. The immediate occasion was a protest against any attempt to tax members of the church for the support of an ecclesiastical system, and a feeling that the church itself should care for its poor and needy. The founder, E.D. Broun, was a conference missionary of the African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church. Others associated with him represented the Methodist Episcopal Church, the Colored Methodist Episcopal Church, the African Methodist Episcopal Church, and the Baptist churches.
DOCTRINE AND POLITY.
In doctrine and polity the church is in general accord with the Methodist bodies, except that it has chiefs or superintendents in place of bishops, and pastors and deacons are the officers in the local church. A chief pastor is chosen to preside over the whole denomination, and all appointments to offices in the church, as well as to pastorates, are made by him. The laity has from the beginning had a share in the conduct of the local church, and also in the general assembly.
WORK.
The principal activity of the church is in the care of the poor, who are provided for directly through the church officers, each local church being expected to provide for its needy ones. There are also district evangelists, appointed by the chief pastor, whose duty it is to care for the unevangelized communities.
STATISTICS.
The general statistics of the denomination at the close of the year 1906, as derived from the returns of the individual church organizations, are given by the states in the tables which follow. As shown by these tables, the denomination has 15 organizations; 14 being in Arkansas and 1 in Oklahoma.
The total number of communicants reported is 1,835; of these, about 40 per cent are males and 60 per cent females. According to the statistics, the denomination has 14 church edifices with a seating capacity of 5,201; church property valued at $5,975, against which there appears an indebtedness of $1,150; and 2 parsonages valued at $450. There are 7 Sunday schools reported, with 63 officers and teachers and 340 scholars.
The number of ministers connected with the denomination is 20, and there are also 10 licentiates.
This body was not reported in 1890.

UNION AMERICAN METHODIST EPISCOPAL CHURCH (COLORED).
HISTORY.
Following the close of the Revolutionary war, the conditions surrounding the colored members of the Methodist churches became somewhat uncomfortable and within a few years separate congregations we formed for worship, though there was no distinct ecclesiastical organization. Among these congregations was one in Wilmington, Del.; where in 1805 the colored members of Asbury Methodist Episcopal Church withdrew and erected a building for themselves. Having now a church of their own, they thought they could have the rule, but found out that they were still under the control of the presiding elder of the district. This did not suit them, but they continued thus until 1812, when there was a general revolt, and in consequence the trustees, including Peter Spencer, William Anderson, and others, were expelled, and many of the families followed. Plans were immediately formed for an independent organization with a new building, and on September 7, 1813, the Union Church of Africans was incorporated. Thirty-one families joined in it, and Peter Spencer and William Anderson were chosen to supervise the work. They appointed members to positions of trust, ordained elders, and gave them authority to ordain others.
During the next thirty-seven years the church developed until there were two annual conferences, Wilmington and New York, including 41 churches, in the states of Delaware, Pennsylvania, New York, and New Jersey. In 1843 the Rev. William Anderson died, and in 1846, the Rev. Peter Spencer. In 1850 a division occurred over the interpretation of certain clauses in the discipline, and out of the division arose on the one hand the African Union Church, and on the other, the Union American Methodist Episcopal Church. For some time the members of the latter, representing the old organization, were compelled to meet in private houses, but after four years a house of worship was erected, and since then the church has grown.
DOCTRINE AND POLITY.
The doctrine is essentially that of the Methodist Episcopal Church, but candidates for membership are required to assent only to the Apostles' Creed. The polity is likewise that of the Methodist Episcopal Church, the chief difference being the provision for a general convention as a constitutional lawmaking body, to be called only when there is under consideration a change in polity or name. The other conferences-general, annual, district, and quarterly-correspond to those in the Methodist Episcopal Church.
WORK.
For home missionary work, such as helping needy churches, about $400 was raised during 1906. Outside of the immediate circle of the churches, work is being carried on in Canada, where there are 3 churches with 150 communicants, and property valued at $5,000. Interest in education brought little practical result until a few years since, when the Union Industrial and Theological Training School was opened in Wilmington, Del., with property valued at about $3,500. In 1906 it reported 6 teachers and 60 students, while $500 was contributed to its support. There were 50 Christian Endeavor societies with 600 names enrolled, and a Young Peoples' Union with 300 members, while in some churches the young men are organized as “Sons of Spencer.”
STATISTICS.
The general statistics of the denomination at the close of the year 1906, as derived from the returns of the individual church organizations, are given by states and ecclesiastical divisions in the tables which follow. As shown by these tables, the denomination has 77 organizations in 5 conferences, distributed in 9 states. Of these organizations, 46 are in the North Atlantic division, Pennsylvania leading with 22.
The total number of communicants reported is 4,347; of these, about 41 per cent are males and 59 per cent females. According to the statistics, the denomination has 60 church edifices; a seating capacity for church edifices of 16,046; church property valued at $170,150, against which there appears an indebtedness of $40,796; halls, etc., used for worship by 16 organizations; and 4 parsonages valued at $6,400. There are 78 Sunday schools reported, with 481 officers and teachers and 3,372 scholars.
The number of ministers connected with the denomination is 64.
As compared with the report for 1890, these figures show an increase of 35 organizations and 2,068 communicants, but a decrease of $17,450 in the value of church property.

AFRICAN METHODIST EPISCOPAL CHURCH
HISTORY.
Soon after the Revolutionary war colored members of the Methodist Episcopal Church in different places, dissatisfied with conditions, began to hold separate services, hoping thus to secure larger privileges and more freedom of action than they believed were possible in continued association with their white brethren, and also to avoid certain humiliating discriminations practiced against them. They styled themselves, for the most part, African Methodists, simply because they were of African descent and Methodists, and not because they thought of permanently dissociating themselves from the Methodist Episcopal Church.
Thus as early as 1787 a company of colored Methodists in Philadelphia withdrew, built a chapel, and obtained a colored preacher through ordination by Bishop White of the Protestant Episcopal Church. In 1793 Bishop Asbury dedicated, in Philadelphia, the Bethel Church, built by Richard Allen, a well-to-do negro, and the platform adopted by the congregation included the following:
“We consider every child a member of the mystical body of Christ, ∗ ∗ ∗ yet in the political government of our church we prohibit our white brethren from electing or being elected into any office among us, save that of a preacher or public speaker.” As reasons for this action they gave the “inconveniences arising from white people and people of color mixing together in public assemblies, more particularly in places of public worship.”
In 1799 Allen was ordained deacon, and the church, according to an arrangement already made, remained under the discipline of the Methodist Episcopal Church and the jurisdiction of a white older. This arrangement, however, did not work very well, and contentions between the white and colored Methodists of the city increased to such an extent that an appeal was made to the supreme court of Pennsylvania. The court declared in favor of the Bethel Church, which thus became an independent body. In 1814 the Methodist Episcopal elders announced that the white preachers could no longer maintain pastoral responsibility for the colored congregation, and in 1816 Richard Allen and 15 others called a number of similar societies, which had been formed in New Jersey, Delaware, and Maryland to meet in Philadelphia, to organize a church of colored persons with autonomous government. This convention was hold in April of that year, and resulted in the organization of the African Methodist Episcopal Church. The movement received the cordial assistance and sympathy of a number of white persons, among them were Dr. Benjamin Rush, Robert Ralston, William McKean, and Bishop White of the Protestant Episcopal Church.
The general doctrine and polity of the Methodist Episcopal Church were adopted, and Richard Allen was elected bishop and consecrated by five regularly ordained ministers, one of whom was a priest of the Protestant Episcopal Church. Among the points emphasized in this first conference were the duty of loyalty and obedience to civil government, and the parity of the ministry on such basis that any minister coming from another denomination should be received in the same official standing that he held in the church from which he came.
For the first twenty years the operations of the new denomination were confined chiefly to Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Delaware, and Maryland. Later they were extended to the New England states, New York, Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Missouri, Kentucky, and Louisiana, in the last state being represented in new Orleans alone. Previous to the civil war, comparatively little was being done in the Southern states, but during the war, through the influence of two chaplains in the United States Army, the Rev. W.H. Hunter and the Rev. H. M. Turner, and of some colored soldiers who were also preachers, two organizations were formed in the South Atlantic coast. After the war the church extended rapidly throughout the South, and today it is represented in each of the original slave states, while its northern field includes the Northern states from the Atlantic to the Pacific, and Ontario in Canada.
Bishop B.W. Arnett, for many years the church statistician, gives the following figures, illustrating the development of the church by decades from 1826 to 1896:

DOCTRINE AND POLITY.
As already indicated, the African Methodist Episcopal Church is, in doctrine and polity, in substantial agreement with the Methodist Episcopal Church.1See Methodist Episcopal Church, page 432 In polity the chief difference is, that in the latter the bishops are itinerant, traveling at large throughout the denomination, while in the African Church the territory is divided into episcopal districts, over each of which a bishop is appointed, and for which he is held responsible. The place of residence of the bishop is left to each, and is not acted upon by the church officially. In case of the death or disability of a bishop in the interval between the general conferences, the Board of Bishops is empowered to rearrange the work of Episcopal supervision.
In order to systematize the income of the different departments of church activity and to secure sufficient funds to enable the bishops to employ their whole time in traveling throughout their districts, a general financial plan was adopted by the general conference of 1840. Every preacher holding a charge was instructed to collect 2 cents a month from each member, the amount thus raised to be applied to the relief of the distressed itinerant, superannuated, and supernumerary preachers; to the bishops' salaries; and to a fund for carrying on the work of the Book Concern. This general plan has been retained by subsequent general conferences, though with some changes. In 1868 the “dollar law” was enacted, providing that each preacher should collect $1 from each member per annum, of which one-fourth was to go to the general book steward; one-fourth to the treasurer of Wilberforce University; and the remainder to the annual conference of the preacher. At present the apportionment is as follows: Church extension, 10 per cent; annual conferences, 36 per cent; and the financial department of the church, for general purposes, 54 per cent. The summary of receipts and expenditures in this last department for the two years 1905 and 1906 shows total receipts, $204,140, and total expenditures, $206,323. The financial department has been reorganized at different times, and is now located at Washington, D. C.
WORK.
The missionary work of the church is carried on by the Parent Home and Foreign Missionary Society and the Woman's Parent Mite Missionary Society, which include annual conference and other auxiliary societies, and by the Woman's Home and Foreign Missionary Society with auxiliaries.
The Parent Home and Foreign Missionary Society, which has general charge of the missionary activities of the church, was organized in 1844, as a result of the report of the work of William Paul Quinn, who was commissioned by the general conference of 1840 as the church's first general missionary, and was sent out to organize churches and temperance societies, and to establish schools for children. The missionary work in the South was begun as early as 1863, but at present the society conducts mission schools and organizes churches throughout the United States and in foreign lands. Outside the United States the fields occupied are Canada; West Africa, including Liberia and Sierra Leone; South Africa, including the Transvaal, Orange River Colony, and Cape Town; the West Indies; and British Guiana. In the quadrennium, 1864 to 1868, the amount raised was $5,425. Since that period the amount has gradually increased, in somewhat varying ratio, until from 1900 to 1903 the sum of $80,815 was raised.
In 1898 Bishop H. M. Turner organized the Transvaal and the South African Annual conferences of the African Methodist Episcopal Church, in South Africa, the former with a church membership of 7,175, and the latter with a membership of 3,625. The membership in these conferences has since been materially increased by their connection with what is known as the Ethiopian Movement in South Africa, a number of churches formerly connected with the Wesleyan Missionary Society of England having withdrawn from that organization on account of its position on the race question.
There is published under the auspices of the Missionary Society a paper called the “Voice of Missions,” giving general church news, but emphasizing missionary matters. The general financial support of the missionary department is secured by 75 per cent of an annual collection taken by the churches and Sunday schools on Easter Sunday, which is supplemented by money raised by the auxiliary missionary, societies. The receipts for 1906 include the following: Easter collections, $24,413; Parent Home and Foreign Missionary Society collections, $4,405; Woman's Home and Foreign Missionary Society collections, $2,203; Woman's Parent Mite Missionary Society collections, $8,005; making a total of $39,026, of which $24,376 went to the missionary department, and $14,650 to the conferences. The sum apportioned to the missionary department was divided between the home and foreign work as follows: 60 per cent, or $14,626, to the home field, and 40 per cent, or $9,750, to the foreign work.
In close relation with the missionary department is the department of church extension, organized for the purpose of caring for weak and struggling churches, and assisting in the mission work. At first it was connected with the Parent Home and Foreign Missionary Society, but in 1892 it was established on a separate footing. It is supported by revenues accruing from 10 per cent of the “dollar money” fund, 50 per cent of all “children's day money,” admission fees, annual dues of the woman's department, special collections, etc. The total receipts from 1892 to 1906 were $232,687, the receipts for the two years 1905 and 1906 being $45,309, indicating a steady increase.
If one-half of this amount be taken as the receipts for 1906, and to it be added the amount apportioned to the missionary society, the total amount for home missions in 1906 will be $37,280.
The interest of the African Methodist Episcopal Church in education is indicated by the fact that a special educational department was organized in 1884. There are now under its supervision 20 institutions, classified so as to include primary, industrial, normal, scientific, collegiate, and university courses, besides 3 parochial or mission schools. Wilberforce University, at Wilberforce, Ohio, is the central institution, and connected with it is the Payne Theological Seminary. There is also the Turner Theological Seminary, at Atlanta, Ga., and arrangements have been made at several of the other schools for chairs of theology or correspondence courses.
The income of these institutions includes a nominal sum from the students for tuition, board, room rent, etc., an appropriation by the general conference of 8 per cent of the “dollar money,” and other contributions and appropriations as may be specifically needed. The third Sunday in September of each year is set apart as educational endowment day, and all churches and Sunday schools in the connection are required to hold a rally for that cause.
The latest report shows over $125,000 spent annually in the maintenance of these schools, which employ 190 teachers and have over 6,000 students, including 300 pupils in mission schools. The value of the school property is about $950,000 and of the endowments, $25,000.
The Sunday School Union has for its special purpose the systematizing of Sunday school work among colored people, providing literature and text-books, and distributing Sunday school literature among the Sunday schools of the connection. For the purpose of forwarding this work a special children's day, the second Sunday in June, has been set apart, and 50 per cent of the amount raised on that day is devoted to the general interests of Sunday school work. The amount received during 1906 was $28,382.
The publication department is the oldest in the church, originating in 1817, when the first Church Discipline was printed. In 1841 the first number of the African Methodist Episcopal Magazine appeared, and was followed by a number of weekly papers-the Christian Herald (later called the Christian Recorder), the Southern Christian Recorder, and others-all of which have done a great work in the development of the church. The special literary magazine of the church is the African Methodist Episcopal Review.
The general conference of 1900, at Columbus, Ohio, organized the Allen Christian Endeavor League on the same general plan as the Epworth League and the Christian Endeavor Society. The church has an aid society called the Connectional Preachers' Aid Society and Mutual Relief Association, organized in Baltimore, Md., in 1897.
STATISTICS.
The general statistics of the denomination at the close of the year 1906, as derived from the returns of the individual church organizations, are given by states and territories and ecclesiastical divisions in the tables which follow. As shown by these tables, the denomination has 6,647 organizations in 59 conferences, distributed in 43 states and territories. Of these organizations, 2,981 are in the South Atlantic division and 2,698 in the South Central division; the state having the largest number being Georgia with 1,226.
The total number of communicants reported is 494,777; of these, as shown by the returns for 6,486 organizations, about 37 per cent are males and 63 per cent females. According to the statistics, the denomination has 6,538 church edifices; a seating capacity for church edifices of 1,832,600, as reported by 6,178 organizations; church property valued at $11,303,489, against which there appears an indebtedness of $1,191,921; halls, etc., used for worship by 268 organizations; and 1,783 parsonages valued at $1,255,246. The Sunday schools, as reported by 6,056 organizations, number 6,285, with 41,941 officers and teachers and 292,689 scholars.
The number of ministers connected with the denomination is estimated at 6,200.
As compared with the report for 1890, these figures show an increase of 4,166 organizations, 42,052 communicants, and $4,835,209 in the value of church property.

AFRICAN UNION METHODIST PROTESTANT CHURCH.
HISTORY.
This body is a union of two distinct organizations, the African Union Church and the First Colored Methodist Protestant Church. The former had its origin in the movement started in Wilmington, Del., in 1813, when the Union Church of Africans was incorporated. In 1850 there was a division in the church over the interpretation of certain clauses in the Discipline, and out of that arose on the one hand the African Union Church, and on the other the Union American Methodist Episcopal Church.1See Union American Methodist Episcopal Church (Colored), page 444. In 1865 a movement was started for uniting the African Union Church, which then comprised 9 congregations, with the First Colored Methodist Protestant Church, comprising 14 congregations, an outgrowth of the Methodist Protestant Church. The union was effected in August, 1866, and the name adopted was “The African Union First Colored Methodist Protestant Church of America or Elsewhere,” ordinarily known as the African Union Methodist Protestant Church.
In general, the doctrine is identical with that of the Methodist Episcopal Church, while the polity differs considerably, agreeing rather with that of the Methodist Protestant Church. It accords equal rights to ministers and laymen, has lay delegates in the annual conferences and the general conference, no bishops, and no higher office than that of elder. The itinerancy is observed, and ministers are paid such salaries as are agreed upon by the members of the church they serve. The conference is divided into three districts, and each district is divided into circuits and home missionary stations.
The church carries on no foreign missionary work, and its home missionary work is conducted by the pastors. There are no educational institutions.

AFRICAN METHODIST EPISCOPAL ZION CHURCH.
HISTORY.
Among the early independent colored Methodist congregations in this country was one organized in New York city in 1796 by James Varick, Abraham Thompson, William Miller, and others, who were members of the John Street Methodist Episcopal Church. Their desire to have a separate organization in which “they might have opportunity to exercise their spiritual gifts among themselves, and thereby be more useful to one another,” was occasioned largely by the “caste prejudice [which] forbade their taking the sacrament until the white members were all served,” and the desire for other church privileges denied them. The first church was built in the year 1800, and was called “Zion.” The next year it was incorporated as the African Methodist Episcopal Church, and articles of agreement were entered into with the Methodist Episcopal Church by which the latter supplied them with ordained preachers until the year 1820. Meanwhile the organization of the Union American Methodist Episcopal Church in Wilmington, Del., and of the African Methodist Episcopal Church in Philadelphia, as separate and distinct denominations, caused considerable uneasiness, and the Zion Church made application to the Methodist Episcopal Church for the ordination of some of its local preachers as elders. To this no answer was given, and in 1820, as the congregation had developed several preachers of ability, it formally withdrew from the supervision of white pastors, and, in connection with churches which had been formed at New Haven, Conn., Philadelphia, Pa. and Newark, N. J., and on Long Island, N. Y., made plans for an entirely separate organization.
The first annual conference was held in Mother Zion Church, corner of Church and Leonard streets, New York city, June 21, 1821. At that time the denomination consisted of 6 churches, 19 preachers, and 1,426 members. As they had no ordained elders at this time, the conference was presided over by the Rev. William Phoebus, of the Methodist Episcopal Church, and the Rev. Joshua Soule, of the same church, acted as secretary. James Varick, who, from his activity and influence, is generally spoken of as the founder of the denomination, was made district chairman.
The second annual conference, which was also the first general conference, met in Wesley Church, Lombard street, Philadelphia, May 16, 1822, and was presided over by Abraham Thompson. After some routine business, it adjourned to meet July 18 in Mother Zion Church, New York. In the meantime, on June 17, James Varick, Abraham Thompson, and Levin Smith were ordained elders by Dr. James Covel, Sylvester Hutchinson, and William Stillwell, all white, elders of the Methodist Episcopal Church. At this conference, on July 21, six persons were elected deacons in the forenoon and elders in the afternoon, and James Varick was elected the first superintendent or bishop of the denomination. No other general conference was held until 1828, when Christopher Rush was elected the second bishop of the denomination. After Bishop Varick's death, in 1827, Bishop Rush served alone until 1840, when William Miller was elected as his associate. It was not until 1848 that the present name of the church was adopted.
At the general conference, of 1852 a difference of opinion arose with regard to the parity of the superintendents or bishops, which divided the denomination into two wings, but the breach was healed, and in 1860 the two factions reunited.
The African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church did not begin operations in the South until 1863, when Bishop Joseph J. Clinton sent Elder James W. Hood to North Carolina and Elder Wilbur G. Strong to Florida and Louisiana, though work was not begun until the following January. The appointment to North Carolina was specially fortunate, and churches sprang up rapidly. Men only just emancipated from the yoke of slavery felt themselves called to enter the ministry and to preach the gospel to their own people. Before the year closed the North Carolina Conference was organized, the parent of 5 conferences in that state, with a combined membership in 1906 of over 600 local churches. The success in Florida, Louisiana, and Alabama was not so phenomenal, but the missionary effort in these states proved to be most fruitful. This is especially true of Alabama, where there are 4 large conferences. So successful were the efforts of these early missionaries that when the general conference met in 1880 at Montgomery, Ala., 15 annual conferences had been organized in the South.
The general conference of 1880 was an important one. Livingstone College was established at Salisbury, N. C., the Rev. C. R. Harris being its first principal. Two years later, on his return from England, where he had collected $10,000 for the college, the Rev. Joseph C. Price, considered, one of the greatest champions of negro citizenship, was made president, and continued in this office until his death, in 1893. The Star of Zion, the chief weekly organ of the church, was adopted by this general conference as a permanent organ of the denomination, and the first organized missionary effort was instituted by the formation of a Board of Missions and a Woman's Missionary Society.
DOCTRINE AND POLITY.
In doctrine the African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church is in entire accord with the Methodist Episcopal Church, accepting the Apostles' Creed and adhering strictly to the doctrine of the new birth, regeneration followed by adoption, and entire sanctification. It recognizes the Scriptures as Written by holy men as they were moved by the Holy Ghost. In polity, also, it is in substantial agreement with that church, having, the same system of conferences-quarterly, annual, and general. The itinerancy is maintained throughout all ranks of ministers. A bishop holds office for life or during good behavior, but he may be assigned quadrennially to different districts, and may be retired, when feebleness or general disability warrants it, on $1,000 a year. The widows of bishops receive a stipend of $300 annually. The membership of the general conference is made up of the bishops and general denominational officers ex officio, ministerial delegates from the annual conferences in the ratio of 1 for every 15 active pastors where there are over 40 members of conference, and two lay delegates from each annual conference, except for such as are entitled to but one ministerial delegate. The salaries of bishops and general denominational officers, except such as are paid by their respective departments, are paid from a general fund secured by an annual assessment of 50 cents on each member of the church.
WORK.
At the general conference of 1892 an effort was made to quicken the missionary spirit of the denomination, and a Board of Education was appointed, but it appeared that the time was not quite ripe, and both the missionary and the educational benevolences were destined to wait until a later period. At the general conference of 1896 a new financial plan was adopted by which the bishops were to receive a better support, and the educational work was made more secure. It was not until the general conference of 1904 that the general work of the church was thoroughly organized in regular departments.
The work of home missions is under the care of a board appointed by the general conference. One-half of the apportionment for this cause goes to assist preachers engaged in mission work in the conference in which it is collected. On an order from the bishops, wherever exigencies require it, this amount is supplemented by funds in the hands of the corresponding secretary. At present, portions of Louisiana, Mississippi, and the states beyond the Mississippi river, especially Oklahoma, are regarded as special mission fields. During the year 1906 the amount spent in home missionary work was $8,000.
In close connection with the home missionary work is that of church extension, carried on by a special board, which helps in the erection of churches in cities, towns, and rural districts where missionaries are employed and the congregations are weak. The board maintains a regular loan fund, an emergency fund, and an annuity fund. A certain amount is apportioned to each pastoral charge to be raised annually for this work. During the year 1906 the sum of $15,000 was thus expended.
The foreign missionary Work is carried on by the Foreign Mission Board of the general conference, which maintains stations in British Honduras, the Dominican Republic, the Bahama Islands, and Liberia and other points on the west coast of Africa. There are in all about 15 regular missionaries, over one-half of whom are natives, besides a number of helpers. Three schools are maintained in Africa. The value of property in the foreign field is placed at $13,000, of which $3,000 represents school property. Contributions for the foreign mission work in 1906 amounted to $3,000, aside from the appropriation for the schools.
The church has now a regular Board of Education, with headquarters at Winston-Salem, N. C., which has supervision over all schools. Money collected for education is sent to the corresponding secretary, who, under the advice of the board, apportions to each school its percentage. Eleven regularly established schools are conducted, including Livingstone College, and the funds for their support are raised by apportionment to each pastoral charge, and by a freewill offering from each Sunday school. These 11 schools have an attendance of about 2,000, and send out about 150 graduates each year. About 50 teachers are employed, at an average salary of $500. Four schools do academic work, while the others do mainly grammar school and industrial work. The value of the school property in the United States is estimated at $150,000.
STATISTICS.
The general statistics of the denomination at the close of the year 1906, as derived from the returns of the individual church organizations, are given by states and ecclesiastical divisions in the tables which follow. As shown by those tables, the denomination has 2,204 organizations in 33 conferences, distributed in 32 states and the District of Columbia. Of these organizations, 1,103 are in the South Atlantic division, North Carolina leading with 673.
The total number of communicants reported is 184,542; of these, as shown by the returns for 2,156 organizations, about 37 per cent are males and 63 per cent females. According to the statistics, the denomination has 2,131 church edifices; a seating capacity for church edifices of 690,951, as reported by 2,048 organizations; church property valued at $4,833,207, against which there appears an indebtedness of $474,269; halls, etc., used for worship by 78 organizations; and 348 parsonages valued at $350,690. The Sunday schools, as reported by 2,060 organizations, number 2,092, with 16,245 officers and teachers and 107,692 scholars.
The number of ministers connected with the denomination is 3,082, and there are also about 384 exhorters and licentiates.
As compared with the report for 1890, these figures show an increase of 500 organizations, 544 church edifices, and $2,119,079 in the value of church property, but a decrease of 165,246 in the number of communicants. In other words, the statistics for 1906, as compared with those given in the report for 1890, show that, while there have been substantial increases in the number of organizations—29.3 per cent—and in the number of church edifices—34.3 per cent—and a very material increase—78.1 per cent—in the value of church property, the present number of communicants is not much more than one-half the former number, or 184,542 in 1906 as against 349,788 in 1890.
The method of securing the statistics for 1906 has been such, however, as to preclude the probability of any great error with respect to either the number of communicants or any of the other items of inquiry. The statistics, in all cases, were obtained direct, either from the pastors or presiding elders, and the greater part of them were secured by a personal canvass by agents sent out from this office. Furthermore, the figures have been subjected to a most careful scrutiny and verification from authoritative sources and are believed to be substantially correct; therefore it is quite evident that the number of communicants as given in the report for 1890 was too high.

COLORED METHODIST EPISCOPAL CHURCH.
HISTORY.
From the earliest appearance of the Methodists in the South considerable evangelistic work was carried on among the slave population, and special missions were begun as early as 1829 for those on the plantations who were not privileged to organize churches. In 1845, at the time of the organization of the Methodist Episcopal Church, South, there were in that church, according to Bishop McTyeire, 124,000 colored members, and in 1860 about 207,000. At the close of the war a large number joined the African Methodist Episcopal Church, the African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church, and other colored Methodist bodies, only 78,742 remaining.
At this time the practical results of the proclamation of emancipation brought about a crisis in the affairs of the colored church members. Before the war, so far as the Methodist churches were concerned, the slaves, as a rule, worshiped in the same churches with their masters, the galleries or a portion of the body of the house being assigned to them. If a separate building was needed, the negro congregation was an appendage to the white, the pastor preaching to it usually once on Sunday, holding separate official meetings, and making return of colored members for the annual minutes. Under the new order the customs formerly prevailing became inconvenient, and it was apparent that the new conditions must be provided for.
In the general conference of 1866 of the Methodist Episcopal Church, South, a committee on the religious interests of colored people presented two reports, one of which was as follows:
Your committee recommend the adoption of the following in reference to the education of the colored people:
Whereas the condition of the colored people of the South is now essentially changed; and
Whereas the interests of the white and colored people are materially dependent upon the intelligence and virtue of this race, that we have had and must continue to have among us; and
Whereas the Methodist Episcopal Church, South, has always claimed to be the friend of that people, a claim vindicated by the conscious and successful exertions made in their behalf, in instructing and evangelizing them; and it is important that we continue to evince our interest for them in this regard; and as our hearts prompt us to this philanthropy: Therefore,
Resolved, That we recommend to our people the establishment of day schools, under proper regulations and trustworthy teachers, for the education of colored children.
The other report presented the following answers to the question, “What shall be done to promote the religious interest of colored people?”
1. Let our colored members be organized as separate pastoral changes, wherever they prefer it, and their numbers justify it.
2. Let each pastoral charge of colored members have its own quarterly conference, composed of official members, as provided for in the Discipline.
3. Let colored persons be licensed to preach, and ordained deacons and elders, according to the Discipline, when in the judgment of the conference having jurisdiction in the case, they are deemed suitable persons for said office and order in the ministry.
4. The bishop may form a district of colored charges and appoint to it a colored presiding elder, when in his judgment the religious interests of the colored people require it.
5. When it is judged advisable by the college of bishops, annual conferences of colored preachers may be organized, to be presided over by our bishops.
6. When two or more annual conferences shall be formed, let our bishops advise and assist them in organizing a separate general conference jurisdiction for themselves, if they so desire, and the bishops deem it expedient, in accordance with the doctrine and discipline of our church, and bearing the same relation to the general conference as the annual conferences bear to each other.
7. Let special attention be given to Sunday schools among the people.
These recommendations were adopted, and at the next general conference, held in Memphis, Tenn., in May, 1870, it was found that in accordance with this plan 5 annual conferences had been organized among the colored members, and that it was their unanimous desire to be set apart as a distinct ecclesiastical body. This was approved by the bishops of the Methodist Episcopal Church, South, and steps were taken for the organization of a general conference of the colored members. This was effected on December 16, 1870, at Jackson, Tenn., the new body taking the name of the Colored Methodist Episcopal Church. The denomination started with 2 bishops, comparatively few preachers and members, and 5 small annual conferences; no schools, but little church property, 110 learned men, no leaders with experience in the intricacies of church work, and no money with which to carry on that work. Still it entered upon its task with energy, and its growth has been steady.
DOCTRINE AND POLITY.
In doctrine the Colored Methodist Episcopal Church is in complete harmony with the Methodist Episcopal Church1. 1 See Methodist Episcopal Church, page 432. Its polity is also essentially the same, with only such variations as the conditions seem to require. The annual conference includes four lay delegates from each presiding elder's district. The general conference consists of the bishops, who, however, have no right to vote, and of delegates elected from the annual conferences, both ministers and laymen. The itinerant system is retained, the time limit for preachers to remain in one church being six years. Admission to church membership is decided largely by the pastors. The probation system is retained, but with no time limit, the pastor deciding when a candidate is fit for full membership.
For the financing of the general activities of the church an assessment of 40 cents per annum is levied on each member, which is divided as follows: Bishop's salaries, 10 cents; education, 10 cents; missions, 10 cents; publication interests, 3 cents; superannuated preachers, widows, and orphans, 7 cents. There is also an additional assessment of 1 cent per annum, which goes toward the church extension fund.
WORK.
The general activities of the Colored Methodist Episcopal Church are chiefly in the line of home missions and education. The Board of Church Extension has been successful in its efforts to increase the strength of the denomination, and in this has been assisted to a great degree by the Woman's Missionary Society. During the year 1906 they employed 95 missionaries, aided 107 churches, and received contributions amounting to $18,340. No foreign missionary work is undertaken.
The church has given special attention to the cause of education and its Board of Education has been active in developing, schools of every grade. In 1906 there, were 14 schools, including 4 colleges and 10 lower grade schools. The colleges had an attendance of 1,450 students, and the other schools an attendance of 2,720. The amount contributed during the year for the general expenses and for the erection of buildings was $95,000. The property is valued at $356,000, and the endowments, at $37,550.
Young people's societies numbered 985, with 12,655 members.
STATISTICS.
The general statistics of the denomination at the close of the year 1906, as derived from the returns of the individual church organizations, are given by states and territories and ecclesiastical divisions in the tables, which follow. As shown by these tables, the denomination has 2,381 organizations in 26 conferences, distributed in 24 states and territories. Of these organizations, 1,703 are in the South Central division; the state having the largest number is Georgia with 402.
The total number of communicants reported is 172,996; of these, as shown by the returns for 2,309 organizations, about 38 per cent are males and 62 per cent females. According to the statistics, the denomination has 2,327 church edifices; a seating capacity for church edifices of 758,328, as reported by 2,214 organizations; church property valued at $3,017,849, against which there appears an indebtedness of $215,111; halls, etc., used for worship by 78 organizations; and 421 parsonages valued at $237,547. The Sunday schools, as reported by 2,207 organizations, number 2,328, with 12,375 officers and teachers and 92,457 scholars.
The number of ministers connected with the denomination is 2,671.
As compared with the report for 1890, these figures show an increase of 622 organizations, 43,613 communicants, and $1,304,483 in the value of church property.

REFORMED ZION UNION APOSTOLIC CHURCH (COLORED).
HISTORY.
At the close of the civil war the colored Methodists in southeastern Virginia, especially in the counties of Mecklenburg, Brunswick, and Lunenburg, found themselves in a peculiar situation. They were no longer permitted to gather for worship in the white churches, had no educated ministry, and were not in sympathy with the ecclesiasticism of the colored Methodist denominations. For several years the more influential men, mostly former slaves, had endeavored to form some sort of organization to meet their own immediate needs. In April, 1869, Elder James R. Howell, from New York, a minister of the African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church, met with them at Boydton, Mecklenburg county, and the result was the organization of the Zion Union Apostolic Church. At a meeting in October a constitution was adopted and Elder Howell was elected president. Five years later he was elected bishop for life, under a change of constitution, but dissensions, largely personal in character, soon arose, and for two years the church was completely disorganized.
In 1881, Elder John M. Bishop, one of the most prominent of the founders, gathered together the scattered members, effected a union, and in 1882 the church was reorganized under the name of “Reformed Zion Union Apostolic Church.” Elder Bishop was elected bishop, and since then the church had prospered.
The doctrine and polity of the Methodist Episcopal Church are, in general, accepted, with the episcopate and a series of conferences. Under the earliest organization the episcopate was to limited to a presidency of four years, but subsequently a change was made, and the bishop has now a life tenure. There is but one ordination required for eldership, and a circuit system is in force. The general conference meets annually in August.
There is no organized home missionary enterprise, but a considerable number of evangelists are employed to care for the spiritual interests of communities where there are no regular churches.
The great need of the church has been an educated ministry. A site for a college has been purchased, but funds have not yet been secured for the erection of a building, or for the provision of teachers.
STATISTICS.
The general statistics of the denomination at the close of the year 1906, as derived from the returns of the individual church organizations, are given by states in the tables which follow. As shown by these tables, the denomination has 45 organizations; 39 of which are in Virginia and 6 in North Carolina.
The total number of communicants reported is 3,059; of these, as shown by the returns for 36 organizations, about 41 per cent are males and 59 per cent females. According to the statistics, the denomination has 43 church edifices; a seating capacity for church edifices of 15,700, as reported by 38 organizations; and church property valued at $37,875, against which there appears an indebtedness of $825. There are 36 Sunday schools reported, with 212 officers and teachers and 1,508 scholars.
The number of ministers connected with the denomination is 33, and there are also 8 licentiates.
As compared with the report for 1890, these figures show an increase of 13 organizations, 713 communicants, and $22,875 in the value of church property.

REFORMED METHODIST UNION EPISCOPAL CHURCH (COLORED).
HISTORY.
In 1884 a number of ministers and members of the African Methodist Episcopal Church withdrew from that body on account of differences in regard to the election of ministerial delegates to the general conference. In January, 1885, a convention of delegates representing churches in South Carolina and Georgia was held and the Independent Methodist Church was organized. The Rev. William E. Johnston, was elected president, emphasizing thug the non-episcopal character of the denomination. Later, however, in 1896, it was decided to make a change in this respect, and create an episcopacy, on the ground that the body would thus acquire more permanent force and recognition among Methodist Episcopal churches, and the name “Reformed Methodist Union Episcopal Church” was adopted.
The doctrines of the church are those of the Methodist Episcopal Church. In its polity also it accords with that church very fully, retaining the class meetings, love feasts, and the different conferences quarterly district, church, annual, and general. There are, however, no presiding elders, each pastor being empowered (within his own charge) with the business that was defined as belonging to the distinctive office of presiding elder.
